\Processor{Collect}

This processor requires a \texttt{count} parameter and a \texttt{key} to
be specified. The implementation will wait for a number of
\texttt{count} data items and collect these in a list. As soon as
\texttt{count} items have been collected, a new, empty item will be
created which holds an array of the collected items in the attribute
specified by \texttt{key}.

While waiting for \texttt{count} items to arrive, the processor will
return \texttt{null} for each collected data item, such that no
subsequent processors will be executed in a process.

After emitting the collected data items, the counter is reset and the
processor starts collecting the next \texttt{count} items.
