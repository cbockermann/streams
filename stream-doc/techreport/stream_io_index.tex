%\subsubsection{Package {\ttfamily stream.io}}
\subsection{\label{app:dataStreams}\label{api:stream:io}Data Stream Implementations}

Reading data is usually the first step in data processing. The package
{\ttfamily stream.io} provides a set of data stream implementations
for data files/resources in various formats.

All of the streams provided by this package do read from URLs, which
allows reading from files as well as from network URLs such as HTTP
urls or plain input streams (e.g. standard input).

The streams provide an iterative access to the data and use the default
\texttt{DataFactory} for creating data. They do usually share some
common parameters supported by most of the streams such as
\texttt{limit} or \texttt{username} and \texttt{password}.

\subsubsection*{Defining a Stream}
As discussed in Section \ref{sec:designingProcesses}, a stream is
defined within a container using the XML {\ttfamily stream} element,
providing a {\ttfamily url} and {\ttfamily class} attribute which
determines the source to read from and the class that should be used
for reading from that source. In addition, the definition requires a
third attribute {\ttfamily id}, which assigns the stream with a
(unique) identifier. This identifier is then used to reference the
stream as input to a process.

As a simple example, the following XML snippet defines a data stream
that reads data items in CSV format from some file URL:
\begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \begin{lstlisting}{lang=xml}
           <stream  id="csv-data" class="stream.io.CsvStream"
                   url="file:/tmp/example.csv" />
        \end{lstlisting}
        \caption{Defining a CSV stream from a file.}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Streaming Data from various URLs}
The \streams runtime supports a list of different URL schemes which
are provided by all Java virtual machines, e.g. {\ttfamily http} URLs
or {\ttfamily file} URLs. Custom URL schemes can also be registered
within the Java VM. As of this, the \streams runtime additionally
offers a {\ttfamily classpath:} and a {\ttfamily system:} URL scheme.

The {\ttfamily classpath:} URLs can be used to create data streams
that read from resources which are available on the classpath. This is
useful for providing example sources within custom JAR files or the
like. The following example shows how to create a stream that reads
data in JSON format from a resource {\ttfamily example.json} that is
searched for in the default classpath:
\begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \begin{lstlisting}{lang=xml}
           <stream  id="json-stream"  class="stream.io.JSONStream"
                   url="classpath:/example.json" />
        \end{lstlisting}
        \caption{\label{fig:jsonStreamClasspath}Defining a JSON stream from a classpath resource.}
\end{figure}

To support streams that read data from standard input or standard
error, the library provides the {\ttfamily system:} URL schema. This
schema provides access to the system input and error streams and are
useful when piping data to a stream via the command line, e.g. by
running a command like:
\begin{figure}[h!]
\sample{\# cat data.csv | stream.run my-process.xml}
\end{figure}
To define a stream that reads from standard input, simply specify
{\ttfamily system:input} as the streams URL as shown in figure
\begin{figure}[h1]
        \centering
        \begin{lstlisting}{lang=xml}
           <stream  id="example"  class="stream.io.CsvStream"
                   url="system:input" />
        \end{lstlisting}
        \caption{\label{fig:csvStreamStdin}Defining a CSV stream that reads data from the system's standard input.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{\label{api:stream:queues}Queue Implementations}
The notion of queues is similar to the definition of streams within
the \streams framework. Queues provide can be attached as sources to
processes while also allowing to be fed with data items from other
places. This allows for simple inter-process communication by
forwarding data items from one process to the queue that is read by
another different process.
