\subsubsection{Average}

The \emph{Average} processor computes a continuous average over all
numeric keys provided in the data items processed. If the \texttt{keys}
parameter is specified, then only the selected keys are averaged.

Non-numberic keys/attributes will be ignored.

The processor will replace the value of the processed items with the
current average. In the following example only the \texttt{error} key is
averaged and the current average is stored in the processed item:

\begin{verbatim}
 <Average keys="error" />
\end{verbatim}
\paragraph{Anytime StatisticsService}

By providing an additional \texttt{id} attribute, this processor will be
registered as anytime \emph{StatisticsService} and can then be queried
for statistics (averages) of all observed keys.

For more details, see the
(StatisticsService){[}StatisticsService.html{]} documentation.
