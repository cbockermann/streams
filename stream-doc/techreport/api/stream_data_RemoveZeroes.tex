\subsubsection{RemoveZeroes}

This processor will remove any values which equal 0 in the numerical
sense. This can be used to remove a large number of features to create a
sparse item:

\begin{verbatim}
  <RemoveZeroes />
\end{verbatim}
Special attributes, such as \texttt{@label} or similar are left
untouched.
