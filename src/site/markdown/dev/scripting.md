Scripting
=========

Scripting languages provide a convenient way to integrate ad-hoc
functionality into your stream-process. Based on the Java Scripting
Engine, the streams library includes support for several scripting
languages, most notably the JavaScript language.

Currently the following scripting languages are supported:

   - JavaScript
   - JRuby (if jruby-library provided in classpath)

Further support for integrating additional languages is planned.
