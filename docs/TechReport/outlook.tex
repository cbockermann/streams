\section{\label{sec:Outlook}Conclusion and Future Work}
In this work we presented a simple abstraction API for modelling
continuous streaming processes and implementing custom processors and
services. On top of this layer of abstraction we implemented a
RapidMiner \plugin\  that integrates the stream oriented processing into
the RapidMiner suite. This allows for processing of continuous data or
large batch data sets using sequential single item or mini batch
processing.
%
%The API is simple to extend and new operators can easily be integrated
%by following ...

Future work will focus on integrating MOA into the \streams library,
making more data mining algorithms available for online processing. In
addition we seek for extending the remote access for other web service
protocols like SOAP. An interesting extension will be the integration
of distribution capabilities, e.g. by incorporating support for
backend infrastuctures like Twitter's {\em Storm} framework.
