\subsubsection{Sum}

This simple processor computes a continuous sum over all numberic keys
of all items processed. The result of this processor is to replace the
values in the processed items by the current some of each key.

If the \texttt{keys} parameter is provided, then only the sum of the
specified keys is computed (for those that are numeric, i.e.~of type
Integer, Float, Double or Long).

For example the following setup will first update the sum for
\texttt{error} and \texttt{memorySize} and will then replace the values
for these keys with the overall sums:

\begin{verbatim}
 <Sum keys="error,memorySize" />
\end{verbatim}
After the processor, the item contains as \texttt{error} the sum of all
\texttt{error} values seen so far (the same holds for
\texttt{memorySize}).

\paragraph{Anytime Statistics Service}

The processor can be registered as service and then provides an anytime
serice of type \texttt{StatisticsService}. This service implementation
can then be queried for the sum value of all observed keys/attributes.

For more details, see the
(StatisticsService){[}StatisticsService.html{]} documentation.
