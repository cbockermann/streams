\section{\label{sec:applications}Example Applications}
In this section we will give a more detailed walk-through of some
applications and use-cases that the \streams library is used for.
These examples come from various domains, such as pre-processing
of scientific data, log-file processing or online-learning by
integrating the MOA library.

Most of the use-cases require additional classes for reading and
processing streams, e.g. stream implementations for parsing
domain-specific data formats. Due to the modularity of the
\streams library, domain-specific code can easily be
added and directly used within the process design.
