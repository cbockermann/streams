\subsubsection{\label{sec:streamsClassifiers}Classifiers in \streams}
The abstract functionality provided by classifiers from the perspective
of the \streams framework encapsulates two functions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item {\bf Training:} Incorporate new data items into a prediction model.
  \item {\bf Application:} Provide a prediction for a data item based on the current model.
\end{enumerate}
These two tasks are mapped onto two different aspects of the compute
graph that builds the basis for the streaming processes. The {\em
  training} is considered to be part of the general data flow,
i.e. data items are processed by classifiers and will be used to
enhance the prediction model provided by the classifier.

The model {\em application}, i.e. the prediction based on the current
model of the classifier, is regarded as an {\em anytime service} that
is provided by the classifier. This service provides a {\ttfamily
  predict(Data)} function that is expected to return the prediction of
the classifier.

     public interface Classifier extends Service {
         /**
          * This method returns a simple prediction based on the given
          * data item. The prediction is a general serializable value.
          */
         public Serializable predict( Data item );
     }
  \end{lstlisting}
  \caption{\label{fig:classifierService}The {\ttfamily Classifier}
    service interface that needs to be implemented by classifiers in
    the \streams framework. The return type of the {\ttfamily predict}
    method might be a number, e.g. for regression or a String, Integer
    or similar for a classification task.}
