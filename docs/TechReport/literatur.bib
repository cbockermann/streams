  ABSTRACT = {Purpose: High-risk neuroblastoma remains a therapeutic challenge for pediatric oncologists. The Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is highly expressed in many human cancers and is a target of the novel small-molecule inhibitor BI 2536, which has shown promising anticancer activity in adult malignancies. Here, we investigated the effect of BI 2536 on neuroblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo to explore PLK1 as a potential target in high-risk neuroblastoma therapy.

Experimental Design:PLK1 transcript levels were analyzed by microarrays in 476 primary neuroblastoma specimens, and correlation with prognostic markers and patient outcome was examined. To explore the effect of PLK1 inhibition on neuroblastoma cells, 7 cell lines were treated with BI 2536 and changes in growth properties were determined. Furthermore, nude mice with IMR-32 and SK-N-AS xenografts were treated with BI 2536.

Results: PLK1 is highly expressed in unfavorable neuroblastoma and in neuroblastoma cell lines. Expression of PLK1 is associated with unfavorable prognostic markers such as stage 4, age >18 months, MYCN amplification, unfavorable gene expression-based classification, and adverse patient outcome (P < 0.001 each). On treatment with nanomolar doses of BI 2536, all neuroblastoma cell lines analyzed showed significantly reduced proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and cell death. Moreover, BI 2536 abrogated growth of neuroblastoma xenografts in nude mice.

Conclusions: Elevated PLK1 expression is significantly associated with high-risk neuroblastoma and unfavorable patient outcome. Inhibition of PLK1 using BI 2536 exhibits strong antitumor activity on human neuroblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo, opening encouraging new perspectives for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma.

  ABSTRACT = {MOTIVATION: The result of a typical microarray experiment is a long    list of genes with corresponding expression measurements. This list    is only the starting point for a meaningful biological interpretation.    Modern methods identify relevant biological processes or functions    from gene expression data by scoring the statistical significance    of predefined functional gene groups, e.g. based on Gene Ontology    (GO). We develop methods that increase the explanatory power of this    approach by integrating knowledge about relationships between the    GO terms into the calculation of the statistical significance. RESULTS:    We present two novel algorithms that improve GO group scoring using    the underlying GO graph topology. The algorithms are evaluated on    real and simulated gene expression data. We show that both methods    eliminate local dependencies between GO terms and point to relevant    areas in the GO graph that remain undetected with state-of-the-art    algorithms for scoring functional terms. A simulation study demonstrates    that the new methods exhibit a higher level of detecting relevant    biological terms than competing methods.},

  ABSTRACT = {Integrating data from heterogeneous data sources is a critical problem that has received a great deal of attention in recent years. There are two competing approaches to address this problem. The traditional approach, which first appeared in Multibase and more recently in HERMES and TSIMMIS, often called global-as-view, defines the global model as a view on the sources. A more recent approach, sometimes referred to as local-as-view or view rewriting, defines the sources as views on the global model. The disadvantage of the first approach is that a person must re-engineer the definitions of the global model whenever any of the sources change or when new sources are added. The view rewriting approach does not suffer from this drawback, but the problem of rewriting queries into equivalent plans using views is computationally hard and must be performed for each query at run-time.
In this paper we propose a hybrid approach that amortizes the cost of query processing over all queries by pre-compiling the source descriptions into a minimal set of integration axioms. Using this approach, the sources are defined in terms of the global model and then compiled into axioms that define the global model in terms of the sources. These axioms can be efficiently instantiated at run-time to determine the most appropriate rewriting to answer a query and facilitate traditional cost-based query optimization. Our approach combines the flexibility of the local-as-view approach with the run-time efficiency of the query processing in global-as-view systems. We have implemented this approach for the SIMS and Ariadne information mediators and provide empirical results that demonstrate that in practice the approach scales to large numbers of sources and that the approach can compile the axioms for a variety of real-world domains in a matter of seconds.},

  ABSTRACT = {In a series of 40 neuroblastomas we analyzed the relative mRNA levels of the MDR associated genes encoding MDR1/P-glycoprotein (MDR1), multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP), lung cancer resistance related protein (LRP) and topoisomerase IIalpha (TOPO IIalpha) by cDNA-PCR. Cyclin A (CYCA) was included to examine cellular proliferation activity. MYCN gene expression was analyzed as it was recently shown to be associated with enhanced MRP gene expression in neuroblastomas. We found that tumors with MYCN gene amplification exhibit significantly increased MYCN and MRP gene expression levels. Tumors with an allelic loss of the chromosomal 1p region showed significant (P<0.05) lower MDR1 gene expression (MDR1: 50+/-29, n=4) than tumors without (MDR1: 117+/-81, P<0.05, n=36). Moreover, significant positive correlations were found for MYCN/TOPO IIalpha (P<0.0001), MYCN/CYCA (P<0.05), TOPO IIalpha/CYCA (P<0.01), MRP/CYCA (P<0.0001) and MRP/LRP (P<0.05). Our results give evidence that MDR in neuroblastomas might be caused by multiple resistance factors and that a higher proliferation rate of neuroblastoma cells possibly based on altered MYCN gene expression is associated with enhanced MRP, CYCA and TOPO IIalpha gene expression.}

  ABSTRACT = {Many Geographic Information System (GIS) applications require the conversion of an address to geographic coordinates. This process is called geocoding. The traditional geocoding method uses a street vector data source, such as, Tigerlines, to obtain address range and coordinates of the street segment on which the given address is located. Next, an approximation technique is used to estimate the location of the given address using the address range of the selected street segment. However, this provides inaccurate results since the approximation assumes that properties exist at all possible addresses and all properties are of equal size. To address the inaccuracy of the traditional geocoding approach, we propose two new methods for geocoding using additional online data sources. The first method, the uniform-lot-size method, uses the number of addresses/lots present on the street segment to approximate the location of an address. The second method, the actual-lot-size method, takes into consideration the lot sizes on the street segment and the orientation of the lots as well. Moreover, we describe an implementation of these methods using an information mediator to obtain information about actual number of lots and sizes of the lots on the streets from various property tax web sites. We geocoded an area covering 13 blocks (267 addresses) using all three methods. Our evaluation shows that the traditional method results in an average error of 36.85 meters, while the uniform-lot-size and the actual-lot-size methods result in the average error of 7.87 meters and 1.63 meters, respectively.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this paper we address the problem of on-chip memory selection for computationally intensive applications, by proposing scratch pad memory as an alternative to cache. Area and energy for different scratch pad and cache sizes are computed using the CACTI tool while performance was evaluated using the trace results of the simulator. The target processor chosen for evaluation was AT91M40400. The results clearly establish scratchpad memory as a low power alternative in most situations with an average energy reduction of 40\%. Further the average area-time reduction for the scratchpad memory was 46\% of the cache memory.},

  ABSTRACT = {IMS2 is an Integrated Medical Software system for the analysis of	Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS) data. It assists medical staff with	the following IMS data processing steps: acquisition, visualization,	classification, and annotation. IMS2 provides data analysis and interpretation	features on the one hand, and also helps to improve the classification	by increasing the number of the pre-classified datasets on the other	hand. It is designed to facilitate early detection of lung cancer,	one of the most common cancer types with one million deaths each	year around the world. After reviewing the IMS technology, we first	describe the software architecture of IMS2 and then the integrated	classification module, including necessary pre-processing steps and	different classification methods. The Lung Hospital Hemer (Germany)	provided IMS data of 35 patients suffering from lung cancer and 72	samples of healthy persons. IMS2 correctly classifies 99\% of the	samples, evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.},

  ABSTRACT = {We introduce a mixture model of trees to describe evolutionary processes    that are characterized by the ordered accumulation of permanent genetic    changes. The basic building block of the model is a directed weighted    tree that generates a probability distribution on the set of all    patterns of genetic events. We present an EM-like algorithm for learning    a mixture model of K trees and show how to determine K with a maximum    likelihood approach. As a case study, we consider the accumulation    of mutations in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase that are associated    with drug resistance. The fitted model is statistically validated    as a density estimator, and the stability of the model topology is    analyzed. We obtain a generative probabilistic model for the development    of drug resistance in HIV that agrees with biological knowledge.    Further applications and extensions of the model are discussed.},

  ABSTRACT = {{In the past decade a sufficient effort has been expended on attempting to come up with a documentrepresentation which is richer than the simple Bag-Of-Words (BOW). One of the widely explored approachesto enrich the BOWrepresentation is in using n-grams (usually bigrams) of words in addition to(or in place of) single words (unigrams). After more than ten years of unsuccessful attempts to improvethe text categorization results by applying bigrams, many researchers agree that there might be a certainlimitation in usability of bigrams for text categorization. We analyze the related works and discuss possiblereasons for this limitation. In addition, we demonstrate our own attempt to incorporate bigrams ina document representation based on distributional clusters of unigrams, and report (statistically insignificant)improvement to our baseline results on the 20 Newsgroups (20NG) dataset. Nevertheless, thereported result is (to our knowledge) the best categorization result ever achieved on this highly populardataset.}},

  ABSTRACT = {We present a novel unsupervised learning scheme that simultaneously clusters variables of several types (e.g., documents, words and authors) based on pairwise interactions between the types, as observered in co-occurence data. In this scheme, multiple clustering systems are generated aiming at maximizing an objective function that measures multiple pairwise mutual information between cluster variables. To implement this idea, we propose an algorithm that interleaves top-down clustering of some variables and bottom-up clustering of the other variables, with a local optimization correction routine. Focusing on document clustering we present an extensive empirical study of two-way, three-way and four-way applications of our scheme using six real-world datasets including the 20 Newsgroups (20NG) and the Enron email collection. Our multi-way distributional clustering (MDC) algorithm consistently and significantly outperform previously state-of-the-art information theoretic clustering algorithms.},

  ABSTRACT = {Assembling suitable groups of fighting units to combat incoming enemy groups is a tactical necessity in real-time strategy (RTS) games. Furthermore it heavily influences future strategic decisions like unit building. Here, we demonstrate how to efficiently (offline) solve the problem of finding matches for the current enemy group(s) based on self-organizing maps (SOMs), powered by a simple evolutionary algorithm. The concept is implemented and thoroughly experimentally investigated in the RTS game Glest. We show that the offline learning is reliable and can be sped up considerably by employing a very simple substitute objective function instead of game simulations, making it a nearly universal, simple, and transparent technique.},

  ABSTRACT = {The creation of interesting opponents for human players in computer games is an interesting and challenging task. In contrast to up-to-date computer games, e.g. real time strategy games, learning of non-player-character strategies for older games seems to be easier and not that time-consuming. This way, older games, like the famous arcade game Pac-Man, serve as a test bed for the creation of strategies that are fun to play against. The paper at hand uses computational intelligence methods to accomplish this challenge, namely evolutionary algorithms (EA) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The latter are trained on a model of the game whereas the EA learn good behavior by playing. The performance of these two approaches is compared on the original Pac-Man level as well as on other maps with different properties to test the ability of generalizing the learned strategies.},

  ABSTRACT = {The problem of identifying approximately duplicate records in databases is an essential step for data cleaning and data integration processes. Most existing approaches have relied on generic or manually tuned distance metrics for estimating the similarity of potential duplicates. In this paper, we present a framework for improving duplicate detection using trainable measures of textual similarity. We propose to employ learnable text distance functions for each database field, and show that such measures are capable of adapting to the specific notion of similarity that is appropriate for the field's domain. We present two learnable text similarity measures suitable for this task: an extended variant of learnable string edit distance, and a novel vector-space based measure that employs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for training. Experimental results on a range of datasets show that our framework can improve duplicate detection accuracy over traditional techniques.},

  ABSTRACT = {Policy-based inference control of queries submitted to a logic-oriented information system
requires us to consider the history of queries and answers to a particular user.
In most previous approaches, the control system captures the history by maintaining a fictitious view
the user is supposed to generate by exploiting rational reasoning. In this paper, we propose
and explore an alternative option to represent the history, namely
by suitably adapting the confidentiality policy after returning an answer to a query.
Basically, such a policy adaption precomputes all relevant steps
of formal proofs that the fictitious view logically implies some  policy element.
We focus on propositional information systems.},

  ABSTRACT = {Being deluged by exploding volumes of structured and unstructured data contained in databases, data warehouses, and the global Internet, people have an increasing need for critical information that is expertly extracted and integrated in personalized views. Allowing for the collective efforts of many data and knowledge workers, we offer in this paper a framework for addressing the issues involved. In our proposed framework we assume that a target view is specified ontologically and independently of any of the sources, and we model both the target and all the sources in the same modeling language. Then, for a given target and source we generate a target-to-source mapping, that has the necessary properties to enable us to load target facts from source facts. The mapping generator raises specific issues for a user's consideration, but is endowed with defaults to allow it to run to completion with or without user input. The framework is based on a formal foundation, and we are able to prove that when a source has a valid interpretation, the generated mapping produces a valid interpretation for the part of the target loaded from the source.}

Even more,  update transaction protocols must ensure both integrity and confidentiality of information which results in a conflicting situation rather involved.
To avoid confidentiality breaches, previous work allow views with misinformation provided to clients.
In order to maintain correctness and reliability of information, we propose query and update protocols that refuse client requests for the sake of confidentiality. 
Further, this article focuses on availability of information in two ways: 
confidentiality policy specification can impose less strict confidentiality in favor of availability;
the proposed transaction protocol is shown to be as cooperative and to provide as much information as possible
among a discussed class of transaction protocols.  
Regarding the confidentiality policy, in our approach the security administrator can choose between protecting only sensitive information in the current instance or even outdated information of previous instances.},

  ABSTRACT = {In multiagent systems, agents interact and in particular exchange information to achieve a joint goal, e.g., arrange a meeting, negotiate a sales contract etc.  
An agent, as a rational reasoner, is able to incorporate new information into her belief about her environment (belief revision) or to share her belief with other agents (query answering). 
Yet, such an agent might be interested to hide confidential parts of her belief from other negotiating agents while these agents are supposed to reason about her reactions to revisions and queries. 
We study how an agent can control her reactions to revisions and queries requested by another agent who may attempt to skeptically entail confidential beliefs. 
As our main contribution, we present procedures that provably enforce confidentiality, to be employed by the reacting agent.},

  ABSTRACT = {In mediated information systems clients and various autonomous sources are brought together by mediators. The mediation paradigm needs powerful and expressive security mechanisms considering the dynamics and conflicting interests of the mediation participants. Firstly, we discuss the security requirements for mediation with an emphasis on confidentiality and authenticity. We argue for basing the enforcement of these properties on certified personal authorization attributes rather than on identification. Using a public key infrastructure such personal authorization attributes can be bound to asymmetric encryption keys by credentials. Secondly, we propose a general design of secure mediation where credentials are roughly used as follows: clients show their eligibility for receiving requested information by the contained personal authorization attributes, and sources and the mediator guarantee confidentiality by using the contained encryption keys. Thirdly, we refine the general design for a specific approach to mediation, given by our prototype of a Multimedia Mediator, MMM. Among other contributions, we define the authorization model and the specification of query access authorizations within the framework of ODL, as well as the authorization and encryption policies for mediation, and we outline the resulting security architecture of the MMM. We also analyze the achievable security properties including support for anonymity, and we discuss the inevitable tradeoffs between security and mediation functionality.}

  ABSTRACT = {To gain insight into mechanisms controlling ecosystem regeneration, we investigated a grassland that was heavily polluted by a phosphate fertilizer factory between 1960 and 1990. Abiotic and biotic filters that influenced species assemblage and succession were monitored and restoration approaches assessed. Studies included the investigation of soil parameters, impact of abiotic stress on microbes and plants, plant succession, recolonization mechanisms, functional group interactions, mycorrhizal diversity and function, and food web analysis. Results indicate that after cessation of pollution, the system had high potential for self-recovery. About 15 years of research are now summarized by interrelating the results of all projects and fitting them into one conceptual model.}

  ABSTRACT = {Mass spectrometry has become one of the most popular analysis techniques	in Proteomics and Systems Biology. With the creation of larger datasets,	the automated recalibration of mass spectra becomes important to	ensure that every peak in the sample spectrum is correctly assigned	to some peptide and protein. Algorithms for recalibrating mass spectra	have to be robust with respect to wrongly assigned peaks, as well	as efficient due to the amount of mass spectrometry data. The recalibration	of mass spectra leads us to the problem of finding an optimal matching	between mass spectra under measurement errors. We have developed	two deterministic methods that allow robust computation of such a	matching: The first approach uses a computational geometry interpretation	of the problem, and tries to find two parallel lines with constant	distance that stab a maximal number of points in the plane. The second	approach is based on finding a maximal common approximate subsequence,	and improves existing algorithms by one order of magnitude exploiting	the sequential nature of the matching problem. We compare our results	to a computational geometry algorithm using a topological line-sweep.},

  ABSTRACT = {MOTIVATION: High-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) is among the most	widely used technologies in metabolomics. Metabolites participate	in almost all cellular processes, but most metabolites still remain	uncharacterized. Determination of the sum formula is a crucial step	in the identification of an unknown metabolite, as it reduces its	possible structures to a hopefully manageable set. RESULTS: We present	a method for determining the sum formula of a metabolite solely from	its mass and the natural distribution of its isotopes. Our input	is a measured isotope pattern from a high resolution mass spectrometer,	and we want to find those molecules that best match this pattern.	Our method is computationally efficient, and results on experimental	data are very promising: for orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometry,	we correctly identify sum formulas for >90\% of the molecules, ranging	in mass up to 1000 Da.},

  ABSTRACT = {In genetics, many evolutionary pathways can be modeled by the ordered accumulation of permanent changes. Mixture models of mutagenetic trees have been used to describe disease progression in cancer and in HIV. In cancer, progression is modeled by the accumulation of chromosomal gains and losses in tumor cells; in HIV, the accumulation of drug resistance-associated mutations in the viral genome is known to be associated with disease progression. From such evolutionary models, genetic progression scores can be derived that assign measures for the disease state to single patients. Rtreemix is an R package for estimating mixture models of evolutionary pathways from observed cross-sectional data and for estimating associated genetic progression scores. The package also provides extended functionality for estimating confidence intervals for estimated model parameters and for evaluating the stability of the estimated evolutionary mixture models.},

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: Mixture models of mutagenetic trees are evolutionary models    that capture several pathways of ordered accumulation of genetic    events observed in different subsets of patients. They were used    to model HIV progression by accumulation of resistance mutations    in the viral genome under drug pressure and cancer progression by    accumulation of chromosomal aberrations in tumor cells. From the    mixture models a genetic progression score (GPS) can be derived that    estimates the genetic status of single patients according to the    corresponding progression along the tree models. GPS values were    shown to have predictive power for estimating drug resistance in    HIV or the survival time in cancer. Still, the reliability of the    exact values of such complex markers derived from graphical models    can be questioned. RESULTS: In a simulation study, we analyzed various    aspects of the stability of estimated mutagenetic trees mixture models.    It turned out that the induced probabilistic distributions and the    tree topologies are recovered with high precision by an EM-like learning    algorithm. However, only for models with just one major model component,    also GPS values of single patients can be reliably estimated. CONCLUSION:    It is encouraging that the estimation process of mutagenetic trees    mixture models can be performed with high confidence regarding induced    probability distributions and the general shape of the tree topologies.    For a model with only one major disease progression process, even    genetic progression scores for single patients can be reliably estimated.    However, for models with more than one relevant component, alternative    measures should be introduced for estimating the stage of disease    progression.},

Each of the various styles of representation is presented in a simple and intuitive form, and the basics of reasoning with that representation are explained in detail. This approach gives readers a solid foundation for understanding the more advanced work found in the research literature.},

  ABSTRACT = {Neuroblastoma is a tumour derived from primitive cells of the sympathetic nervous system and is the most common solid tumour in childhood. Interestingly, most infants experience complete regression of their disease with minimal therapy, even with metastatic disease. However, older patients frequently have metastatic disease that grows relentlessly, despite even the most intensive multimodality therapy. Recent advances in understanding the biology and genetics of neuroblastomas have allowed classification into low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups. This allows the most appropriate intensity of therapy to be selected - from observation alone to aggressive, multimodality therapy. Future therapies will focus increasingly on the genes and biological pathways that contribute to malignant transformation or progression.}

  ABSTRACT = {Data integration is the problem of combining data residing at different autonomous, heterogeneous sources and providing the client with a unified, reconciled global view of the data. We discuss data-integration systems, taking the abstract viewpoint that the global view is an ontology expressed in a class-based formalism. We resort to an expressive description logic, ALCQI, that fully captures class-based representation formalisms, and we show that query answering in data integration, as well as all other relevant reasoning tasks, is decidable. However, when we have to deal with large amounts of data, the high computational complexity in the size of the data makes the use of a full-fledged expressive description logic infeasible in practice. This leads us to consider DL-Lite, a specifically tailored restriction of ALCQI that ensures tractability of query answering in data integration while keeping enough expressive power to capture the most relevant features of class-based formalisms.}

  ABSTRACT = {The Web has been rapidly "deepened" -- with myriad searchable databases online, where data are hidden behind query interfaces. Toward large scale integration over this "deep Web," we are facing a new challenge- With its dynamic and ad-hoc nature, such large scale integration mandates dynamic semantics discovery. That is, we must on-the-fly cope with "semantics" of dynamically discovered sources without pre-configured source-specific knowledge. To tackle this challenge, our initial works hinge on the insight that the large scale is itself also a unique opportunity: We observe that the desired "semantics" often connects to surface presentation characteristics, through some hidden regularities over many sources. Such regularities can be essentially leveraged in enabling semantics discovery. In particular, we report our evidences in three initial tasks for integrating the deep Web: interface extraction, schema matching, and query translation. Generalizing these specific evidences, we thus propose our "unified insight" of "mining" semantics for large scale integration by exploiting hidden regularities across holistic sources. Further, to fulfill the promise of such holistic mining, we discuss challenges toward its realization for dynamic semantics discovery. As our initial works as well as several related efforts have witnessed, we believe our unified insight, holistic mining for semantics discovery, is a promising methodology toward enabling large scale integration.}

  ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we present PVA, an adaptive personal view information agent                    system for tracking, learning and managing user interests in Internet documents.                    PVA consists of three parts: a {\it proxy}, {\it personal view constructor}, and                    {\it personal view maintainer}. The proxy logs the user's activities and                    extracts the user's interests without user intervention. The personal view                    constructor mines user interests and maps them to a class hierarchy (i.e.,                    personal view). The personal view maintainer synchronizes user interests and the                    personal view periodically. When user interests change, in PVA, not only the                    contents, but also the structure of the user profile are modified to adapt to                    the changes. In addition, PVA considers the aging problem of user interests. The                    experimental results show that modulating the structure of the user profile                    increases the accuracy of a personalization system.},

  ABSTRACT = {Part of the process of data integration is determining which sets of identifiers refer to the same real-world entities. In integrating databases found on the Web or obtained by using information extraction methods, it is often possible to solve this problem by exploiting similarities in the textual names used for objects in different databases. In this paper we describe techniques for clustering and matching identifier names that are both scalable and adaptive, in the sense that they can be trained to obtain better performance in a particular domain. An experimental evaluation on a number of sample datasets shows that the adaptive method sometimes performs much better than either of two non-adaptive baseline systems, and is nearly always competitive with the best baseline system.},

  ABSTRACT = {PURPOSE: The clinical significance of MYCN expression in children with neuroblastoma (NB) remains controversial. To determine the prognostic significance of MYCN expression in the absence of MYCN amplification, we analyzed MYCN mRNA and protein expression in tumors from 69 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-nine NB tumor samples with nonamplified MYCN from patients with stage C or D disease were obtained from the Pediatric Oncology Group Neuroblastoma Tumor Bank. MYCN mRNA was analyzed using a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay, and MYCN protein was examined by Western blot analyses. RESULTS: The estimated 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and survival (S) rates plus SE for the cohort were 57\% +/- 17\% and 60\% +/- 16\%, respectively. Infants younger than 1 year had significantly higher rates of EFS and S than children >/= 1 year of age (P =.003 and P <.001, respectively); patients with stage C disease had better outcome than those with stage D NB (P <.001); and patients with hyperdiploid tumors had better outcome than those with diploid NB (P <.001). Surprisingly, outcome was slightly better for patients with high versus low levels of MYCN mRNA expression (4-year S, 70\% +/- 13\% v 50\% +/- 16\%; P =.290), and for patients with tumors that expressed MYCN protein (4-year S, 73\% +/- 19\% v 53\% +/- 15\%, respectively; P =.171). CONCLUSION: High levels of MYCN expression are not prognostic of adverse outcome in patients with advanced-stage NB with nonamplified MYCN. A trend associating high levels of MYCN expression with improved outcome was observed.}

  ABSTRACT = {Kernel methods like Support Vector Machines have successfully been used for text                    categorization. A standard choice of kernel function has been the inner product                    between the vector-space representation of two documents, in analogy with                    classical information retrieval (IR) approaches. Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)                    has been successfully used for IR purposes as a technique for capturing semantic                    relations between terms and inserting them into the similarity measure between                    two documents. One of its main drawbacks, in IR, is its computational cost. In                    this paper we describe how the LSI approach can be implemented in a                    kernel-defined feature space. We provide experimental results demonstrating that                    the approach can significantly improve performance, and that it does not impair                    it.},

  title = {Stability and alignment of MCC/IMS devices},
  year = {2012},
  ID = {de06vrpq80},
  ABSTRACT = {There are numerous analytical detection methods available for human breath investigations. The major spectrometricmethods used are proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PRT-MS) [1?5], selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) [6?10], solid phase micro extraction-gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (SPME-GC/ MS) [11?14], and multi-capillary column coupled to ion mobility spectrometry (MCC/IMS) [15?20]. In all cases mentioned, a non?invasive and an easy method for early diagnosis or therapy monitoring are developed by identifying disease-specific biomarkers in the breath of patients.
Obviously, if the results of these studies are to be valid, consideration of sampling techniques, and the comparison of the inhaled and the exhaled air are some fundamental requirements.
Small changes within the room air can affect the difference between room air and exhaled breath depending on the method selected, for example, patients suffering lung cancer and healthy volunteers. Therefore, in the present paper a study of the stability of two volatiles present in room air ion mobility spectrometry measurements over 6 months is reported, and also the variability of these two volatiles for different MCC/IMS devices is also described.
The present paper considers the influence of temperature and other parameters with small variations in the instrumentation.
General remarks could be found in [21, 22], the influence of temperature in [23?32], pressure in [33], electric field in [34, 35], carrier gas flow [23, 31], geometrical parameters [36, 37]. Therefore, we discuss the inter-comparison of different instruments. Theoretical aspects and in-depth explanations regarding the operating conditions of the MCC/IMS were discussed in the literature mentioned above. The present paper deals with practical points that are to be considered while intercomparing different instruments and show, that a proper alignment is really needed for such purpose.},

  ABSTRACT = {Neuroblastoma (NB) is a paediatric tumour with a remarkable diverse clinical behaviour. Approximately half of the high stage aggressive tumours are characterized by MYCN gene amplification but our understanding of the role of MYCN in NB oncogenesis is incomplete. Previous studies have shown that MYCN expression is inversely correlated with expression of Dickkopf-3 (DKK3), a gene encoding an extracellular protein with presumed tumour suppressor activity, but direct MYCN regulation of DKK3 was excluded leaving the mechanism of regulation unexplained. Given the recently established role of MYCN-regulated miRNAs in downregulation of protein-coding genes and predicted seeds for miR-17-92 cluster members within the DKK3 3?UTR, we hypothesized that this mechanism would act in MYCN regulation of DKK3. To investigate this, we used a validated miR-17-92-inducible cellular system and could demonstrate robust downregulation of DKK3 mRNA and protein levels upon miR-17-92 overexpression. Next, two of the three predicted miRNAs, miR-19b and miR-92a, were shown to lower DKK3 protein levels, in addition to measurable DKK3 mRNA knock-down by miR-92a. Direct interaction between miR-19b or miR-92a and the 3?UTR of DKK3 was validated using luciferase reporter assays. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the MYCN-induced downregulation of DKK3 results from direct upregulation of miR-17-92 components effecting both DKK3 mRNA stability and translation which further contributes to the pleiotropic oncogenic effect of elevated MYCN levels. The strict MYCN-mediated regulation of DKK3 is suggestive for an important downstream function of the MYCN protein and thus warrants further investigations to unravel the role of DKK3 in NB.},

  ABSTRACT = {Angesichts aktueller Herausforderungen wie steigendem Kostendruck und hoher Variantenvielfalt stellt die Realisierung von Verbesserungspotenzialen auch in der Stahlindustrie einen zentralen Wettbewerbsfaktor dar. Vor diesem Hintergrund w\"{a}chst die Bedeutung der z. T. bereits erprobten Prinzipien der Lean Production. Dieser Beitrag beschreibt, wie bei der ThyssenKrupp Nirosta Pr\"{a}zisionsband GmbH ein Fertigungssteuerungskonzept in Anlehnung an diese Prinzipien entwickelt wurde.

Nowadays, realizing rationalization of workflow is an essential competitive factor in the steel industry as well as in other industries. Due to this, principles of lean production gain in importance. This article describes the development of a concept of production control at ThyssenKrupp Nirosta Pr\"{a}zisionsband GmbH which focuses on these principles.},

  ABSTRACT = {Semantic integration has been a long-standing challenge for the database community. It has received steady attention over the past two decades, and has now become a prominent area of database research. In this article, we first review database applications that require semantic integration and discuss the difficulties underlying the integration process. We then describe recent progress and identify open research issues. We focus in particular on schema matching, a topic that has received much attention in the database community, but also discuss data matching (for example, tuple deduplication) and open issues beyond the match discovery context (for example, reasoning with matches, match verification and repair, and reconciling inconsistent data values). For previous surveys of database research on semantic integration, see Rahm and Bernstein (2001); Ouksel and Seth (1999); and Batini, Lenzerini, and Navathe (1986).}

  ABSTRACT = {It is generally accepted that Wrapper approaches willoutperform Filter-based approaches to feature selection, particularly insituations where an adequate amount of data is available. What is oftenoverlooked is that Wrapper approaches can be unstable. For instance, differentpartitionings of the training data can result in di\#erent routes through thesearch space and thus in di\#erent feature subsets being selected. In this paperwe illustrate examples of this problem and a solution based on the aggregationof several runs of a sequential search is suggested. This is essentially anensemble solution to instability in feature subset selection and it does seem tostabilise the process.}

  ABSTRACT = {Selecting a small subset of descriptors from a large pool to build a predictive quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model is an important step in the QSAR modeling process. In general, subset selection is very hard to solve, even approximately, with guaranteed performance bounds. Traditional approaches employ deterministic or stochastic methods to obtain a descriptor subset that leads to an optimal model of a single type (such as linear regression or a neural network). With the development of ensemble modeling approaches, multiple models of differing types are individually developed resulting in different descriptor subsets for each model type. However, it is advantageous, from the point of view of developing interpretable QSAR models, to have a single set of descriptors that can be used for different model types. In this paper, we describe an approach to the selection of a single, optimal, subset of descriptors for multiple model types. We apply this approach to three data sets, covering both regression and classification, and show that the constraint of forcing different model types to use the same set of descriptors does not lead to a significant loss in predictive ability for the individual models considered. In addition, interpretations of the individual models developed using this approach indicate that they encode similar structure-activity trends.}

  ABSTRACT = {Data on the Web in HTML tables is mostly structured, but we usually do not know the structure in advance. Thus, we cannot directly query for data of interest. We propose a solution to this problem based on document-independent extraction ontologies. Our solution entails elements of table understanding, data integration, and wrapper creation. Table understanding allows us to find tables of interest within a Web page, recognize attributes and values within the table, pair attributes with values, and form records. Data-integration techniques allow us to match source records with a target schema. Ontologically specified wrappers allow us to extract data from source records into a target schema. Experimental results show that we can successfully locate data of interest in tables and map the data from source HTML tables with unknown structure to a given target database schema. We can thus "directly" query source data with unknown structure through a known target schema.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper presents techniques to tightly integrate worst-case execution time\textem{(WCET)} information into a compiler framework. Currently, a tightintegration ofWCET information into the compilation process is strongly desired, but only somead-hoc approaches have been reported currently. Previous publications mainlyused self-written WCET estimators with very limited functionality andpreciseness during compilation. A very tight integration of a high qualityindustry-relevant WCET analyzer into a compiler was not yet achieved up to now.This work is the first to present techniques capable of achieving such a tightcoupling between a compiler and the WCET analyzer aiT. This is done byautomatically translating the assembly-like contents of the compiler's low-levelintermediate representation \textem{(LLIR)} to aiT's exchange format CRL2.Additionally, the results produced by the WCET analyzer are automaticallycollected and re-imported into the compiler infrastructure.The work describedin this paper is smoothly integrated into a C compiler environment for theInfineon TriCore processor. It opens up new possibilitiesfor the design of WCET-aware optimizations in the future.The concepts for extending the compiler infrastructure are kept very general sothat they are not limited to WCET information. Rather, it is possible to useour structures also for multi-objective optimization of e.g. best-caseexecution time \textem{(BCET)} or energy dissipation.}

  ABSTRACT = {Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. It is known that overexpression and/or amplification of the MYC oncogene is associated with poor clinical outcome, but the molecular mechanisms and the MYC downstream effectors in MB remain still elusive. Besides contributing to elucidate how progression of MB takes place, most importantly, the identification of novel MYC-target genes will suggest novel candidates for targeted therapy in MB. A group of 209 MYC-responsive genes was obtained from a complementary DNA microarray analysis of a MB-derived cell line, following MYC overexpression and silencing. Among the MYC-responsive genes, we identified the members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway, which have a crucial role during the development of the cerebellum. In particular, the gene BMP7 was identified as a direct target of MYC. A positive correlation between MYC and BMP7 expression was documented by analyzing two distinct sets of primary MB samples. Functional studies in vitro using a small-molecule inhibitor of the BMP/SMAD signaling pathway reproduced the effect of the small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of BMP7. Both approaches led to a block of proliferation in a panel of MB cells and to inhibition of SMAD phosphorylation. Altogether, our findings indicate that high MYC levels drive BMP7 overexpression, promoting cell survival in MB cells. This observation suggests the potential relevance of targeting the BMP/SMAD pathway as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of childhood MB.},

  ABSTRACT = {Neuroblastoma is an aggressive embryonal tumor that accounts for ?15\% of childhood cancer deaths. Hitherto, despite the availability of comprehensive genomic data on DNA copy number changes in neuroblastoma, relatively little is known about the genes driving neuroblastoma tumorigenesis. In this study, high resolution array comparative genome hybridization (CGH) was performed on 188 primary neuroblastoma tumors and 33 neuroblastoma cell lines to search for previously undetected recurrent DNA copy number gains and losses. A new recurrent distal chromosome 1q deletion (del(1)(q42.2qter)) was detected in seven cases. Further analysis of available array CGH datasets revealed 13 additional similar distal 1q deletions. The majority of all detected 1q deletions was found in high risk 11q deleted tumors without MYCN amplification (Fisher exact test p = 5.61 × 10?5). Using ultra-high resolution (?115 bp resolution) custom arrays covering the breakpoints on 1q for 11 samples, clustering of nine breakpoints was observed within a 12.5-kb region, of which eight were found in a 7-kb copy number variable region, whereas the remaining two breakpoints were colocated 1.4-Mb proximal. The commonly deleted region contains one miRNA (hsa-mir-1537), four transcribed ultra conserved region elements (uc.43-uc.46) and 130 protein coding genes including at least two bona fide tumor suppressor genes, EGLN1 (or PHD2) and FH. This finding further contributes to the delineation of the genomic profile of aggressive neuroblastoma, offers perspectives for the identification of genes contributing to the disease phenotype and may be relevant in the light of assessment of response to new molecular treatments.},

  ABSTRACT = {In the traditional setting, text categorization is formulated as a concept                    learning problem where each instance is a single isolated document. However,                    this perspective is not appropriate in the case of many digital libraries that                    offer as contents scanned and optically read books or magazines. In this paper,                    we propose a more general formulation of text categorization, allowing documents                    to be organized as \textit{sequences} of pages. We introduce a novel hybrid                    system specifically designed for multi-page text documents. The architecture                    relies on hidden Markov models whose emissions are bag-of-words resulting from a                    multinomial word event model, as in the generative portion of the Naive Bayes                    classifier. The rationale behind our proposal is that taking into account                    contextual information provided by the whole page sequence can help                    disambiguation and improves single page classification accuracy. Our results on                    two datasets of scanned journals from the Making of America collection confirm                    the importance of using whole page sequences. The empirical evaluation indicates                    that the error rate (as obtained by running the Naive Bayes classifier on                    isolated pages) can be significantly reduced if contextual information is                    incorporated.},

  ABSTRACT = {Mobile devices are a special class of resource-constrained embedded devices. Computing power, memory, the available energy, and network bandwidth are often severely limited. These constrained resources require extensive optimization of a mobile system compared to larger systems. Any needless operation has to be avoided. Time-consuming operations have to be started early on. For instance, loading files ideally starts before the user wants to access the file. So-called prefetching strategies optimize system's operation. Our goal is to adjust such strategies on the basis of logged system data. Optimization is then achieved by predicting an application's behavior based on facts learned from earlier runs on the same system. In this paper, we analyze system-calls on operating system level and compare two paradigms, namely server-based and device-based learning. The results could be used to optimize the runtime behaviour of mobile devices.},

  ABSTRACT = {Huge masses of data and potentially in?nite data streams pose big challenges to methods in data mining that analyse data off-line and in several passes. In the area of intrusion detection, algorithms that detect characteristical patterns in system call data could have to process several hundred megabytes of data per minute. We describe a plugin that contains algorithms for the aggregation of data streams by determining frequent tuples of hierarchical elements, so called Hierarchical Heavy Hitters. We further discuss more general questions concerning the current state of RapidMiner in relation to stream mining.},

  ABSTRACT = {Secure multiparty computation allows parties to jointly compute a function of their private inputs without revealing anything but the output. Theoretical
    results provide a general construction of such protocols for any function. Protocols obtained in this way are, however, ine?cient, and thus, practically speaking, useless
    when a large number of participants are involved.The contribution of this paper is to define a new privacy model - k-privacy - by means of an innovative, yet natural
    generalization of the accepted trusted third party model. This allows implementing cryptographically secure e?cient primitives for real-world large-scale distributed systems.
    As an example for the usefulness of the proposed model, we employ k-privacy to introduce a technique for obtaining knowledge - by way of an association-rule mining algorithm
    - from large-scale Data Grids, while ensuring that the privacy is cryptographically secure.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper describes the Transparent Access to Multiple Bioinformatics Information Sources project, known as TAMBIS, in which a domain ontology for molecular biology and bioinformatics is used in a retrieval-based information integration system for biologists. The ontology, represented using a description logic and managed by a terminology server, is used both to drive a visual query interface and as a global schema against which complex intersource queries are expressed. These source-independent declarative queries are then rewritten into collections of ordered source-dependent queries for execution by a middleware layer. In bioinformatics, the majority of data sources are not databases but tools with limited accessible interfaces. The ontology helps manage the interoperation between these resources. The paper emphasizes the central role that is played by the ontology in the system. The project distinguishes itself from others in the following ways: the ontology, developed by a biologist, is substantial; the retrieval interface is sophisticated; the description logic is managed by a sophisticated terminology server. A full pilot application is available as a JavaTM applet integrating five sources concerned with proteins. This pilot is currently undergoing field trials with working biologists and is being used to answer real questions in biology, one of which is used as a case study throughout the paper.}

  ABSTRACT = {Recently, a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism association	study has identified a sequence variant 30 kb upstream of the c-Myc	gene (allele T of rs9642880) that confers susceptibility to bladder	cancer. However, the role of exposure to bladder carcinogens has	not been considered. This prompted us to analyse the relevance of	this polymorphism in 515 bladder cancer cases and 893 controls where	the quality and quantity of occupational exposure to bladder carcinogens	has been documented. When we analysed a hospital-based case-control	series not selected for occupational exposure, rs9642880[T] was influential,	in contrast to GSTM1 0/0. However, in a case-control series of patients	that have been occupationally exposed to aromatic amines and polycyclic	aromatic hydrocarbons, rs9642880[T] was not influential but GSTM1	0/0 was significantly associated with bladder cancer risk. Therefore,	the degree to which rs9642880[T] and GSTM1 0/0 confer susceptibility	to urinary bladder cancer seems to depend on the extent of exposure	to urinary bladder carcinogens.},

  ABSTRACT = {Unsupervised learning methods often involve summarizing the data using a small number of parameters. In certain domains, only a small subset of the available data is relevant for the problem. One-Class Classification or One-Class Clustering attempts to find a useful subset by locating a dense region in the data. In particular, a recently proposed algorithm called One-Class Information Ball (OC-IB) shows the advantage of modeling a small set of highly coherent points as opposed to pruning outliers. We present several modifications to OC-IB and intergrate it with a global search that results in several improvements such as deterministic results, otpimality guarantees, control over cluster size and extension to other cost functions. Empirical studies yield significantly better results on various real and artificial data.},

  ABSTRACT = {We present a new analytical method for concentration measurements of nano objects of different nature
such as polystyrene nanoparticles or viruses. The method is based on counting single particles of interest
bound to a functionalized sensor surface. The counting rate was used for concentration measurements.
For polystyrene particles, the counting rate was found to be in good agreement with the theoretically
predicted one. Binding of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virus-like particles (VLPs) to the sensor
surface functionalized with antibodies was observed. The concentration of HIV?VLP was estimated by
means of well-characterized solutions of artificial nanoparticles as a reference material. The results are
in a good agreement with standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis. Factors are
discussed which determine the detection power of the method.},

Einem Zeichen auf der lexikalischen Ebene entsprichtein Zeichen -- m\"{o}glicherweise ein Nullzeichen -- auf derOberfl\"{a}chenebene. Dies erm\"{o}glicht mit der gleichen Effizienz sowohldie Analyse als auch die Generierung von Wortformen.Die Hauptmittel von TWOL sind Fortsetzungsklassen und TWOL-Regeln. Inden Fortsetzungsklassen bekommen die W\"{o}rter Flexionsendungen. DieTWOL-Regeln stellen ein bestimmtes Kontext fest, in dem einem Zeichender lexikalischen Ebene ein Zeichen der Oberfl\"{a}chenebene entsprechenkann oder mu{\ss}.Das Alphabet von TWOL besteht neben den Buchstaben und Sonderzeichenauch von diakritischen Zeichen, die die Funktion von TWOL-Regelnsteuern.Bis heute ist das TWOL-System f\"{u}r etwa 30 Sprachen verwendet worden.}}

  ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a simple, yet novel, approach to peak-trough detection	using a rudimentary model of Newtonian mechanics. Based on the line-searching	technique also employed in artificial neural network technology to	determine global minima, the momentum is used to find both peaks	and troughs of a signal. This algorithm provides a fast alternative	to the traditional techniques, which uses contextual information	in order to determine prominent peaks and troughs without requiring	smoothing or thresholding.},

  title = {An Interpretative Approach to the Model-Driven Development of Web Applications},
  school = {University Dortmund},
  year = {2006},
  ID = {emg6tmiz},
  ABSTRACT = {The increasing size and complexity of web applications has led to a
situation where the traditional approach of creating and managing a set
of plain HTML files is inappropriate in many cases. Consistency in
structure, look and feel, and hyperlinks needs to be maintained, and
support for different content formats may be required. The combination
of XML Schema, XML and XSLT is able to improve this situation, but the
expressive power of XML Schema is insufficient for application domains
where more than a pure hierarchical structure is required. In this work,
we have chosen the XML toolchain as a guideline to construct an
alternative basis for web information systems at a higher level of
abstraction, namely UML class diagrams. We have identified a UML
counterpart or implemented a substitute for each constituent of the XML
processing chain, showing that it is possible to build a consistent
UML-based system for model driven web applications. Since our approach
is based on model interpretation, a system prototype can be created by
simply drawing a conceptual model in the form of a UML class diagram---a
step that is required in the relevant development methodologies anyway.
By making this first step immediately operational without any
compilation or transformation steps, the gap between web development
methodologies and actual system implementation has been narrowed
significantly.},

  year = {2011},
  ID = {d5cpjib11c},
  ABSTRACT = {Im MAGIC-Experiment werden zwei Cherenkov-Teleskope betrieben, deren Beobachtungen eine sehr gro{\ss}e Datenmenge erzeugen. Dabei macht jedoch der Anteil der f\"{u}r weitere Analysen interessanten Gamma-Teilchen nur etwa ein Tausendstel aller Ereignisse aus. Diese m\"{u}ssen durch geeignete Verfahren von den \"{u}brigen Ereignissen separiert werden. Es liegt also ein Klassifikationsproblem vor, f\"{u}r dessen L\"{o}sung zur Zeit ein Random Forest verwendet wird. Die sehr gro{\ss}en Datenmengen, die f\"{u}r das Training des Klassifikators zur Verf\"{u}gung stehen, lassen jedoch Klassifikationsverfahren attraktiv erscheinen, die nicht nur eine begrenzte, statische Trainingsmenge nutzen, sondern durch Resampling w\"{a}hrend des Lernens einen beliebig gro{\ss}en Teil der zur Verf\"{u}gung stehenden Daten verwenden. Dazu wird eine Erweiterung des Boosting- Verfahrens Ada2Boost entwickelt, die in einigen Iterationen die Trainingsmenge durch neu gezogene Daten ersetzt.Weiterhin wird Ada2Boost so modifiziert, dass weiche Basisklassifikatoren verwendet werden k\"{o}nnen. Neben des gro{\ss}en Umfangs der Trainingsdaten besteht die Schwierigkeit, dass sich die Verteilungen einiger Merkmale in Abh\"{a}ngigkeit von Umgebungsparametern \"{a}ndern. Diese Eigenschaft wird derzeit nicht oder nur schwach ber\"{u}cksichtigt. In dieser Arbeit wird ein Verfahren entwickelt, das die Daten so partitioniert, dass die Verteilung innerhalb der Partitionen m\"{o}glichst homogen ist, um dann auf jeder Partition ein auf die jeweilige Verteilung spezialisiertes Modell zu trainieren. Das Problem nach der Suche einer optimalen Partitionierung wird in eine Merkmalsselektion transformiert, so dass vorhandene Verfahren zur Merkmalsselektion angewendet werden k\"{o}nnen. Die entwickelten Verfahren werden zur Evaluierung f\"{u}r die Data Mining-Umgebung RapidMiner implementiert. Weiterhin wird ein Framework vorgestellt, mit dem sich RapidMiner-Prozesse auf ein Rechencluster verteilen lassen. Teil I beschreibt die physikalischen Grundlagen und die Vorarbeiten, auf denen die neu entwickelten Verfahren aufbauen. Kapitel 3 gibt einen Einblick in die Herkunft kosmischer Teilchen und den Hintergrund des MAGIC-Experiments. Das derzeit etablierte Klassifikationsverfahren wird beschrieben. Kapitel 4 definiert ein formales Ger\"{u}st f\"{u}r die Klassifikation und erl\"{a}utert wichtige Verfahren zur Bewertung von Klassifikationsmodellen. In Kapitel 5 werden einige konkrete Lernverfahren vorgestellt. Darauf aufsetzende Meta-Verfahren werden in Kapitel 6 beschrieben. Dazu geh\"{o}ren insbesondere Ada2Boost und der Random Forest. Schlie{\ss}lich werden Methoden zur Vorverarbeitung und Merkmalsselektion in Kapitel 7.1 beschrieben. In Teil II werden die neuen Verfahren entwickelt und evaluiert. Kapitel 8 gibt einen kurzen \"{U}berblick \"{u}ber diese Verfahren. Das folgende Kapitel beschreibt die Testumgebung, die zur Evaluierung genutzt wird. Eine statistische Voruntersuchung der MAGIC- Daten findet in Kapitel 10 statt und Kapitel 11 stellt den Recall-Chooser vor, ein Hilfsverfahren, das auf der ROC-Analyse basiert. Kapitel 12 erweitert Ada2Boost um die Nutzung weicher Basisklassifikatoren. Dieses Verfahren wiederum wird in Kapitel 13 um ein Resampling w\"{a}hrend des Lernprozesses erweitert, so dass gro{\ss}e Datenmengen verarbeitet werden k\"{o}nnen. Das Binningverfahren zum Partitionieren der Trainingsmenge wird in Kapitel 14 beschrieben. Zum Vergleich mit dem etablierten Verfahren bewertet Kapitel 15 die neuen Verfahren in Bezug auf den Random Forest. Das letzte Kapitel 16 fasst die Ergebnisse zusammen und gibt einen Ausblick auf m\"{o}glicheWeiterentwicklungen.},

  ABSTRACT = {Current systems that support navigation predict which pages are interesting for the users on the basis of commonalities in the contents or the usage of the pages. They do not take into account the order in which the pages must be visited. In this paper we propose a method to automatically divide the pages of a web site on the basis of user logs into sets of pages that correspond to navigation stages. The method searches for an optimal number of stages and assigns each page to a stage. The stages can be used in combination with the pages? topics to give better recommendations or to structure or adapt the site.},

  ABSTRACT = {Spectral peak detection algorithms are often difficult to automate	because they either rely on somewhat arbitrary rules, or are tuned	to specific spectral peak properties. One popular approach detects	peaks where signal intensities exceed some threshold. This threshold	is typically set arbitrarily above the noise level or manually by	the user. Intensity threshold-based methods can be sensitive to baseline	variations and signal intensity. Another popular peak detection approach	relies on matching the spectral intensities to a reference peak shape.	This approach can be very sensitive to baseline changes and deviations	from the reference peak shape. Such methods can be significantly	challenged by modern analytical instrumentation where the baseline	tends to drift, peaks of interest may have a low signal to noise	(S/N) ratio, and no well-defined reference peak shape is available.	We present a new approach for spectral peak detection that is designed	to be generic and easily automated. Employing a histogram-based model	for spectral intensity, peaks are detected by comparing the estimated	variance of observations (the x-axis of the spectrum) to the expected	variance when no peak is present inside some window of interest.	We compare an implementation of this approach to two existing peak	detection algorithms using a series of simulated spectra.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a Support Vector Method for optimizing multivariate nonlinear performance measures like the F1-score. Taking a multivariate prediction approach, we give an algorithm with which such multivariate SVMs can be trained in polynomial time for large classes of potentially non-linear performance measures, in particular ROCArea and all measures that can be computed from the contigency table. The conventional classification SVM arises as a special case of our method.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a learning theoretical analysis of correlation clustering (Bansal et al., 2002). In particular, we give bounds on the error with which correlation clustering recovers the correct partition in a planted partition model (Condon \& Karp, 2001; McSherry, 2001). Using these bounds, we analyse how the accuracy of correlation clustering scales with the number of clusters and the sparsity of the graph. We also propose a statistical test that analyzes the significance of the clustering found by correlation clustering.},

  ABSTRACT = {A crucial issue for Machine Learning and Data Mining is Feature Selection, selecting the relevant features in order to focus the learning search. A relaxed setting for Feature Selection is known as Feature Ranking, ranking the features with respect to their relevance. This paper proposes an ensemble approach for Feature Ranking, aggregating feature rankings extracted along independent runs of an evolutionary learning algorithm named ROGER. The convergence of ensemble feature ranking is studied in a theoretical perspective, and a statistical model is devised for the empirical validation, inspired from the complexity framework proposed in the Constraint Satisfaction domain. Comparative experiments demonstrate the robustness of the approach for learning (a limited kind of) non-linear concepts, specifically when the features significantly outnumber the examples.},

  ABSTRACT = {We propose a novel probabilistic method, based on latent variable models, for                    unsupervised topographic visualisation of dynamically evolving, coherent textual                    information. This can be seen as a complementary tool for topic detection and                    tracking applications. This is achieved by the exploitation of the a priori                    domain knowledge available, that there are relatively homogeneous temporal                    segments in the data stream. In a different manner from topographical techniques                    previously utilized for static text collections, the topography is an outcome of                    the coherence in time of the data stream in the proposed model. Simulation                    results on both toy-data settings and an actual application on Internet chat                    line discussion analysis is presented by way of demonstration.},

  ABSTRACT = {We conducted a genome-wide SNP association study on 1,803 urinary	bladder cancer (UBC) cases and 34,336 controls from Iceland and The	Netherlands and follow up studies in seven additional case-control	groups (2,165 cases and 3,800 controls). The strongest association	was observed with allele T of rs9642880 on chromosome 8q24, 30 kb	upstream of MYC (allele-specific odds ratio (OR) = 1.22; P = 9.34	x 10(-12)). Approximately 20\% of individuals of European ancestry	are homozygous for rs9642880[T], and their estimated risk of developing	UBC is 1.49 times that of noncarriers. No association was observed	between UBC and the four 8q24 variants previously associated with	prostate, colorectal and breast cancers, nor did rs9642880 associate	with any of these three cancers. A weaker signal, but nonetheless	of genome-wide significance, was captured by rs710521[A] located	near TP63 on chromosome 3q28 (allele-specific OR = 1.19; P = 1. 15	x 10(-7)).},

  ABSTRACT = {The representation formalism as well as the representation language is of great importance for the success of machine learning. The representation formalism should be expressive, efficient, useful, and applicable. First-order logic needs to be restricted in order to be efficient for inductive and deductive reasoning. In the field of knowledge representation, term subsumption formalisms have been developed which are efficient and expressive. In this article, a learning algorithm, KLUSTER, is described that represents concept definitions in this formalism. KLUSTER enhances the representation language if this is necessary for the discrimination of concepts. Hence, KLUSTER is a constructive induction program. KLUSTER builds the most specific generalization and a most general discrimination in polynomial time. It embeds these concept learning problems into the overall task of learning a hierarchy of concepts.},

  ABSTRACT = {MOTIVATION: Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS)	and combined with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) have become	a prominent tool for the analysis of complex proteomic samples. An	important step in a typical workflow is the combination of results	from multiple LC-MS experiments to improve confidence in the obtained	measurements or to compare results from different samples. To do	so, a suitable mapping or alignment between the data sets needs to	be estimated. The alignment has to correct for variations in mass	and elution time which are present in all mass spectrometry experiments.	RESULTS: We propose a novel algorithm to align LC-MS samples and	to match corresponding ion species across samples. Our algorithm	matches landmark signals between two data sets using a geometric	technique based on pose clustering. Variations in mass and retention	time are corrected by an affine dewarping function estimated from	matched landmarks. We use the pairwise dewarping in an algorithm	for aligning multiple samples. We show that our pose clustering approach	is fast and reliable as compared to previous approaches. It is robust	in the presence of noise and able to accurately align samples with	only few common ion species. In addition, we can easily handle different	kinds of LC-MS data and adopt our algorithm to new mass spectrometry	technologies. AVAILABILITY: This algorithm is implemented as part	of the OpenMS software library for shotgun proteomics and available	under the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL) at www.openms.de.},

  ABSTRACT = {Due to fast time-to-market and IP reuse requirements, an increasing    amount of the functionality of embedded HW/SW systems is implemented    in software. As a consequence, software programming languages like    C play an important role in system specification, design, and validation.    Besides many other advantages, the C language offers executable specifications,    with clear semantics and high simulation speed. However, virtually    any tool operating on C specifications has to convert C sources into    some intermediate representation (IR), during which the executability    is normally lost. In order to overcome this problem, this paper describes    a novel IR format, called IR-C, for the use in C based design tools,    which combines the simplicity of three address code with the executability    of C. Besides the IR-C format and its generation from ANSI C, we    also describe its applications in the areas of validation, retargetable    compilation, and sourcelevel code optimization.}

  title = {An Engineering Information Service Infrastructure for Ubiquitous Computing},
  month = {October},
  number = {141},
  year = {2002},
  ID = {fevj33cr},
  ABSTRACT = {This paper describes a software framework for the development of a ubiquitous computing
environment for distributed engineering information services. Two fundamental issues are
addressed: (1) universal accessibility from devices to information services, and (2) collaboration
among the parties accessing the information services. The first issue calls for the development of
device independent information services that have flexibility to support wide range of client
devices. We introduce a mediation-based framework that enables the information clients to
calibrate the source information services to the clients? characteristics. The second issue requires
effective integration of information services. We address the issue from two aspects. First,
information models are required so that heterogeneous information services can communicate
with each other. We define an ontology standard and describe how such standard can be
effectively applied for exchanging scheduling information. Secondly, service integration
requires an environment so that information services can be managed and directed to perform
tasks in collaboration. We illustrate an infrastructure that is particularly suitable for the
integration of engineering services. A prototype for the ubiquitous computing environment has
been developed that incorporates a variety of project management software as well as different
devices ranging from PDA, web browsers, desktop computers, and servers.

These annotations include (i) static information specific to the probeset composition; (ii) sequence annotations extracted from public databases; and (iii) protein sequence-level annotations derived from public domain programs, as well as libraries of hidden Markov models (HMMs) developed at Affymetrix. For each probeset, NetAffx lists the probe sequences, and the consensus sequence interrogated by the probes; for the larger chip sets, interactive maps display this sequence data in genomic context. Sequence annotations include Gene Ontology (GO) terms and depiction of GO graph relationships; predicted protein domains and motifs; orthologous sequences; links to relevant pathways; and links to public databases including UniGene, LocusLink, SWISS-PROT and OMIM.},

  ABSTRACT = {Machine learning has shown its capabilities for an automatic generation of heuristics used by optimizing compilers. The advantages of these heuristics are that they can be easily adopted to a new environment and in some cases outperform hand-crafted compiler optimizations. However, this approach shifts the effort from manual heuristic tuning to the model selection problem of machine learning ? i. e., selecting learning algorithms and their respective parameters ? which is a tedious task in its own right. In this paper, we tackle the model selection problem in a systematic way. As our experiments show, the right choice of a learning algorithm and its parameters can significantly affect the quality of the generated heuristics. We present a generic framework integrating machine learning into a compiler to enable an automatic search for the best learning algorithm. To find good settings for the learner parameters within the large search space, optimizations based on evolutionary algorithms are applied. In contrast to the majority of other approaches aiming at a reduction of the average-case execution time (ACET), our goal is the minimization of the worst-case execution time (WCET) which is a key parameter for embedded systems acting as real-time systems. A careful case study on the heuristic generation for the well-known optimization loop invariant code motion shows the challenges and benefits of our methods.},

  ABSTRACT = {PURPOSE: In the Children's Oncology Group, risk group assignment for neuroblastoma is critical for therapeutic decisions, and patients are stratified by International Neuroblastoma Staging System stage, MYCN status, ploidy, Shimada histopathology, and diagnosis age. Age less than 365 days has been associated with favorable outcome, but recent studies suggest that older age cutoff may improve prognostic precision. METHODS: To identify the optimal age cutoff, we retrospectively analyzed data from the Pediatric Oncology Group biology study 9047 and Children's Cancer Group studies 321p1-p4, 3881, 3891, and B973 on 3,666 patients (1986 to 2001) with documented ages and follow-up data. Twenty-seven separate analyses, one for each different age cutoff (adjusting for MYCN and stage), tested age influence on outcome. The cutoff that maximized outcome difference between younger and older patients was selected. RESULTS: Thirty-seven percent of patients were younger than 365 days, and 64\% were > or = 365 days old (4-year event-free survival [EFS] rate +/- SE: 83\% +/- 1\% [n = 1,339] and 45\% +/- 1\% [n = 2,327], respectively; P < .0001). Graphical analyses revealed the continuous nature of the prognostic contribution of age to outcome. The optimal 460-day cutoff we selected maximized the outcome difference between younger and older patients. Forty-three percent were younger than 460 days, and 57\% were > or = 460 days old (4-year EFS rate +/- SE: 82\% +/- 1\% [n = 1,589] and 42\% +/- 1\% [n = 2,077], respectively; P < .0001). Using a 460-day cutoff (assuming stage 4, MYCN-amplified patients remain high-risk), 5\% of patients (365 to 460 days: 4-year EFS 92\% +/- 3\%; n = 135) fell into a lower risk group. CONCLUSION: The prognostic contribution of age to outcome is continuous in nature. Within clinically relevant risk stratification, statistical support exists for an age cutoff of 460 days.}

  ABSTRACT = {A correlation analysis of peaks found in IMS-Chromatograms was carried out to show the potential of the method in clinical applications. As an example, the data of exhaled breath of patients suffering infections of Pseudomonas were compared to healthy non-smokers. Using a rank sum calculation and providing a correlation table of all peaks found, delivers the basis for visualisation of highest ranked analytes. In addition, a consideration of positive and negative correlated peaks could support sub-grouping, if present. A set of signals could be found for discriminating the two groups of patients using MCC-IMS. Investigations of exhaled breath using ion mobility spectrometry seems to provide a promising means for the non-invasive identification of patients which are colonized or infected with bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa.},

  ABSTRACT = {The recommendations presented here are designed to support easier cross-linking of measurement data from a multicapillary column coupled to an ion mobility spectrometer (MCC/IMS) to a corresponding gas-chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC/MS) data and vice-versa. Much of this document pertains to the updates in the MCC/IMS data header structure regarding the nomenclature of the file names assigned for the GS/MS measurement of the sample, which also has or will have an MCC/IMS measurement. To organize the cross linking between the data obtained from these two different techniques, the authors suggest some important modifications/improvements to the freely available positions in the MCC/IMS data file. The improvements proposed will be described in detail in this document.},

  ABSTRACT = {Support vector machines and kernel methods have recently gained considerable	attention in chemoinformatics. They offer generally good performance	for problems of supervised classification or regression, and provide	a flexible and computationally efficient framework to include relevant	information and prior knowledge about the data and problems to be	handled. In particular, with kernel methods molecules do not need	to be represented and stored explicitly as vectors or fingerprints,	but only to be compared to each other through a comparison function	technically called a kernel. While classical kernels can be used	to compare vector or fingerprint representations of molecules, completely	new kernels were developed in the recent years to directly compare	the 2D or 3D structures of molecules, without the need for an explicit	vectorization step through the extraction of molecular descriptors.	While still in their infancy, these approaches have already demonstrated	their relevance on several toxicity prediction and structure-activity	relationship problems.}

  ABSTRACT = {The support vector machine algorithm together with graph kernel functions	has recently been introduced to model structure-activity relationships	(SAR) of molecules from their 2D structure, without the need for	explicit molecular descriptor computation. We propose two extensions	to this approach with the double goal to reduce the computational	burden associated with the model and to enhance its predictive accuracy:	description of the molecules by a Morgan index process and definition	of a second-order Markov model for random walks on 2D structures.	Experiments on two mutagenicity data sets validate the proposed extensions,	making this approach a possible complementary alternative to other	modeling strategies.},

  ABSTRACT = {Let x and y be two random variables with continuous cumulative distribution functions f and g. A statistic U depending on the relative ranks of the x's and y's is proposed for testing the hypothesis f = g. Wilcoxon proposed an equivalent test in the Biometrics Bulletin, December, 1945, but gave only a few points of the distribution of his statistic. Under the hypothesis f = g the probability of obtaining a given U in a sample of n x's and m y's is the solution of a certain recurrence relation involving n and m. Using this recurrence relation tables have been computed giving the probability of U for samples up to n = m = 8. At this point the distribution is almost normal. From the recurrence relation explicit expressions for the mean, variance, and fourth moment are obtained. The 2rth moment is shown to have a certain form which enabled us to prove that the limit distribution is normal if m, n go to infinity in any arbitrary manner. The test is shown to be consistent with respect to the class of alternatives \$f(x) > g(x)\$ for every x.},

  ABSTRACT = {The clinical hallmark of neuroblastoma is heterogeneity, with the likelihood of cure varying widely according to age at diagnosis, extent of disease, and tumour biology. A subset of tumours will undergo spontaneous regression while others show relentless progression. Around half of all cases are currently classified as high-risk for disease relapse, with overall survival rates less than 40\% despite intensive multimodal therapy. This Seminar focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the biology of this complex paediatric solid tumour. We outline plans for the development of a uniform International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system, and summarise strategies for risk-based therapies. We also update readers on new discoveries related to the underlying molecular pathogenesis of this tumour, with special emphasis on advances that are translatable to the clinic. Finally, we discuss new approaches to treatment, including recently discovered molecular targets that might provide more effective treatment strategies with the potential for less toxicity.}

  ABSTRACT = {OBJECTIVES: We discuss supervised classification techniques applied	to medical diagnosis based on gene expression profiles. Our focus	lies on strategies of adaptive model selection to avoid overfitting	in high-dimensional spaces. METHODS: We introduce likelihood-based	methods, classification trees, support vector machines and regularized	binary regression. For regularization by dimension reduction, we	describe feature selection methods: feature filtering, feature shrinkage	and wrapper approaches. In small sample-size situations efficient	methods of data re-use are needed to assess the predictive power	of a model. We discuss two issues in using cross-validation: the	difference between in-loop and out-of-loop feature selection, and	estimating model parameters in nested-loop cross-validation. RESULTS:	Gene selection does not reduce the dimensionality of the model. Tuning	parameters enable adaptive model selection. The feature selection	bias is a common pitfall in performance evaluation. Model selection	and performance evaluation can be combined by nested-loop cross-validation.	CONCLUSIONS: Classification of microarrays is prone to overfitting.	A rigorous and unbiased assessment of the predictive power of the	model is a must.},

  ABSTRACT = {MOTIVATION: The motif discovery problem consists of finding over-represented patterns in a collection of biosequences. It is one of the classical sequence analysis problems, but still has not been satisfactorily solved in an exact and efficient manner. This is partly due to the large number of possibilities of defining the motif search space and the notion of over-representation. Even for well-defined formalizations, the problem is frequently solved in an ad hoc manner with heuristics that do not guarantee to find the best motif. RESULTS: We show how to solve the motif discovery problem (almost) exactly on a practically relevant space of IUPAC generalized string patterns, using the p-value with respect to an i.i.d. model or a Markov model as the measure of over-representation. In particular, (i) we use a highly accurate compound Poisson approximation for the null distribution of the number of motif occurrences. We show how to compute the exact clump size distribution using a recently introduced device called probabilistic arithmetic automaton (PAA). (ii) We define two p-value scores for over-representation, the first one based on the total number of motif occurrences, the second one based on the number of sequences in a collection with at least one occurrence. (iii) We describe an algorithm to discover the optimal pattern with respect to either of the scores. The method exploits monotonicity properties of the compound Poisson approximation and is by orders of magnitude faster than exhaustive enumeration of IUPAC strings (11.8 h compared with an extrapolated runtime of 4.8 years). (iv) We justify the use of the proposed scores for motif discovery by showing our method to outperform other motif discovery algorithms (e.g. MEME, Weeder) on benchmark datasets. We also propose new motifs on Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Availability and Implementation: The method has been implemented in Java. It can be obtained from http://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/people/marschal/paa\_md/.},

  ABSTRACT = {The speed of processors is currently improving at a much faster rate    than the speed of memories. It has been found that the speed gap    between processors and memories is doubling within at most two years    for many scenarios. This means that, in our quest for speed, we will    hit the memory wall, a situation in which the system speed is limited    by the speed of a relatively slow memory. This speed gap was initially    important just for mainframe and desktop computing but is now also    relevant for embedded devices. Memory hierarchies are seen as the    key approach towards easing the problem. However, cache-based hierarchies    are not energy-efficient and may have a poor timing-predictability.    In the tutorial, we show how the energy efficiency and timing-predictability    can be improved by using software which has been optimized for a    particular memory architecture. The focus is on small scratch-pad    memories (called tightly coupled memories by ARM) and the compiler-based    mapping of hot-spots of applications to these memories. For these    approaches, the compiler needs to be aware of the memory architecture.    We compare static approaches for such a mapping with approaches based    on dynamic overlays managed by the compiler. We also show how the    concept can be applied in multi-threaded and multi-processor environments.    Required optimizations can be added to existing tool chains. The    concepts lead to dramatic improvements in terms of the energy consumption    and timing predictability. Furthermore, the tutorial also covers    some optimizations for caches and briefly puts optimizations for    other levels of the memory hierarchy into perspective.}

We propose methods for selecting,                                                                                            formally specifying, algorithmically implementing,                                                                                            empirically evaluating, and combining behaviors from a                                                                                            basic set.

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: Children with high-risk neuroblastoma have a poor outcome. In this study, we assessed whether myeloablative therapy in conjunction with transplantation of autologous bone marrow improved event-free survival as compared with chemotherapy alone, and whether subsequent treatment with 13-cis-retinoic acid (isotretinoin) further improves event-free survival. METHODS: All patients were treated with the same initial regimen of chemotherapy, and those without disease progression were then randomly assigned to receive continued treatment with myeloablative chemotherapy, total-body irradiation, and transplantation of autologous bone marrow purged of neuroblastoma cells or to receive three cycles of intensive chemotherapy alone. All patients who completed cytotoxic therapy without disease progression were then randomly assigned to receive no further therapy or treatment with 13-cis-retinoic acid for six months. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SE) event-free survival rate three years after the first randomization was significantly better among the 189 patients who were assigned to undergo transplantation than among the 190 patients assigned to receive continuation chemotherapy (34+/-4 percent vs. 22+/-4 percent, P=0.034). The event-free survival rate three years after the second randomization was significantly better among the 130 patients who were assigned to receive 13-cis-retinoic acid than among the 128 patients assigned to receive no further therapy (46+/-6 percent vs. 29+/-5 percent, P=0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with myeloablative therapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation improved event-free survival among children with high-risk neuroblastoma. In addition, treatment with 13-cis-retinoic acid was beneficial for patients without progressive disease when it was administered after chemotherapy or transplantation.}

  ABSTRACT = {The estimation of correct triggers for handover in cellular networks belongs to the critical tasks for accurate network operation. The importance of seamless handover even rises according to the increasing number of available radio access technologies, demanding for a reliable vertical handover. To aid the handover process, mobility prediction technologies gain interest and provide the possibility to prepare for handover in advance. The approaches presented here feature prediction of macro-mobility as an additional measure to aid handover decisions. The prediction is based on statistical data gained from the observation of movement across multiple cells. One of the main features lies in a generic user centric calculation of the most likely next hop during user movement, compared to network specific technological methods.},

  ABSTRACT = {With increasing availability of high bandwidth mobile networks, ranging from classical UMTS up to local IEEE 802.16 cells, efficient management for mobile resources gains additional significance. Approaches targeting at detecting repeating patterns in mobile user movements enable network operators to react to cell handovers and bottle necks in advance. This paper discusses several methods to extract movement patterns from mobile users and analyses sensitiveness to mobility data and algorithm parametrisation.},

  ABSTRACT = {Efficient management of mobile network resources is a critical task for successful operation. Giving higher priority and Quality of Service to applications with a high return on invest value, demands for intelligent distribution of bit rates and radio access. The research approach proposed here is based on the fact, that users cannot move freely, but are restricted to streets or rails in position, direction and speed. Following the geographical topology while in motion some locations generate a unique signature by forcing the user to traverse similar sequences of base stations. The signatures can be revealed by applying pattern detection methods on the historical user movements, allowing to predict future positions of the user on a large time scale, especially to reserve resources for rescue workers. In this paper we discuss the effect of different attributes about the user\'s movement for the prediction quality on different pattern detection algorithms in order to improve and accelerate the process of rescue missions. Further the availability of these attributes will be discussed for different scenarios and validated by traces from an actual large scale HSDPA/GSM network.},

  ABSTRACT = {XML, web services, and the semantic web have opened the door for new and exciting information-integration applications. Information sources on the web are controlled by different organizations or people, utilize different text formats, and have varying inconsistencies. Therefore, any system that integrates information from different data sources must identify common entities from these sources. Data from many data sources on the web does not contain enough information to link the records accurately using state-of-the-art record-linkage systems. However, it is possible to exploit secondary data sources on the web to improve the record-linkage process. We present an approach to accurately and automatically match entities from various data sources by utilizing a state-of-the-art record-linkage system in conjunction with a data-integration system. The data-integration system is able to automatically determine which secondary sources need to be queried when linking records from various data sources. In turn, the record-linkage system is then able to utilize this additional information to improve the accuracy of the linkage between datasets.}

  ABSTRACT = {Das Ergebnis dieser Diplomarbeit ist ein System, das SGML/XML-kodierte Dokumente f\&\#65533;r die Ver\&\#65533;ffentlichung im World Wide Web aufbereitet. Der Benutzer, d.h. der Leser, hat die M\&\#65533;glichkeit, nach Stichworten in einer von mehreren Kategorien zu suchen. Suchbegriff und Suchkategorie ersetzen die h\&\#65533;ufig zu ungenaue Volltextsuche. Im Gegensatz zu den Ausgaben von herk\&\#65533;mmlichen Suchfunktionen erh\&\#65533;lt er als Ergebnis keinen vorgefertigten Ausschnitt aus dem Dokument (z.B. ein Kapitel, einen Abschnitt usw.). Vielmehr wird der Ausschnitt in Abh\&\#65533;ngigkeit der Textstelle bestimmt, die bei der Suche als Treffer ermittelt wurde. Die Definition solcher Dokumentausschnitte und der Suchkategorie findet mit Bezug auf den Dokumenttyp, nicht bez\&\#65533;glich des konkreten Textes statt. Diese Herangehensweise besitzt den Vorteil, notwendige Konfigurationen nur einmal je Dokumenttyp machen zu muessen, die dann fuer saemtliche Dokumente dieses Typs anwendbar sind.},

  ABSTRACT = {Die Autoren geben eine fundierte Einfuhrung in die Informatik, die von Anfang an die Zusammenhange zwischen den Teilgebieten des Faches betont. Das Buch ist kompakt, weil der gemeinsame Kern der verschiedenen Informatikgebiete betrachtet wird. In einer integrativen Sichtweise werden Modellierung, abstrakte Datentypen, Algorithmen sowie nebenlaufige und verteilte Programmierung behandelt. Die grundlegenden Konzepte der Informatik werden dabei mittels der Programmiersprache Java realisiert.

Wesentliches Anliegen der Autoren ist es, die Informatik als Wissenschaft der Abstraktion herauszustellen, und in diesem Sinne den Studierenden allgemeine Methoden zum Losen praktischer Probleme zu vermitteln.

Lernkontrollen und ein effektiver Index, der vor allem diejenigen Begriffe auffuhrt, die ein Informatiker einfach konnen muss, ermoglichen ein fokussiertes Studium. Ferner stehen vielfaltige Programm-Beispiele im Internet bereit.},

  ABSTRACT = {MOTIVATION: The recent advances in metabolomics have created the potential	to measure the levels of hundreds of metabolites which are the end	products of cellular regulatory processes. The automation of the	sample acquisition and subsequent analysis in high-throughput instruments	that are capable of measuring metabolites is posing a challenge on	the necessary systematic storage and computational processing of	the experimental datasets. Whereas a multitude of specialized software	systems for individual instruments and preprocessing methods exists,	there is clearly a need for a free and platform-independent system	that allows the standardized and integrated storage and analysis	of data obtained from metabolomics experiments. Currently there exists	no such system that on the one hand supports preprocessing of raw	datasets but also allows to visualize and integrate the results of	higher level statistical analyses within a functional genomics context.	RESULTS: To facilitate the systematic storage, analysis and integration	of metabolomics experiments, we have implemented MeltDB, a web-based	software platform for the analysis and annotation of datasets from	metabolomics experiments. MeltDB supports open file formats (netCDF,	mzXML, mzDATA) and facilitates the integration and evaluation of	existing preprocessing methods. The system provides researchers with	means to consistently describe and store their experimental datasets.	Comprehensive analysis and visualization features of metabolomics	datasets are offered to the community through a web-based user interface.	The system covers the process from raw data to the visualization	of results in a knowledge-based background and is integrated into	the context of existing software platforms of genomics and transcriptomics	at Bielefeld University. We demonstrate the potential of MeltDB by	means of a sample experiment where we dissect the influence of three	different carbon sources on the gram-negative bacterium Xanthomonas	campestris pv. campestris on the level of measured metabolites. Experimental	data are stored, analyzed and annotated within MeltDB and accessible	via the public MeltDB web server. AVAILABILITY: The system is publicly	available at http://meltdb.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de.},

  ABSTRACT = {Mass Spectrometry (MS) is increasingly being used to discover diseases-related	proteomic patterns. The peak detection step is one of the most important	steps in the typical analysis of MS data. Recently, many new algorithms	have been proposed to increase true position rate with low false	discovery rate in peak detection. Most of them follow two approaches:	one is the denoising approach and the other is the decomposing approach.	In the previous studies, the decomposition of MS data method shows	more potential than the first one. In this paper, we propose two	novel methods, named GaborLocal and GaborEnvelop, both of which can	detect more true peaks with a lower false discovery rate than previous	methods. We employ the method of Gaussian local maxima to detect	peaks, because it is robust to noise in signals. A new approach,	peak rank, is defined for the first time to identify peaks instead	of using the signal-to-noise ratio. Meanwhile, the Gabor filter is	used to amplify important information and compress noise in the raw	MS signal. Moreover, we also propose the envelope analysis to improve	the quantification of peaks and remove more false peaks. The proposed	methods have been performed on the real SELDI-TOF spectrum with known	polypeptide positions. The experimental results demonstrate that	our methods outperform other commonly used methods in the Receiver	Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.}

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND. Overexpression of the gene for the multidrug-resistance-associated protein (MRP) has been linked with resistance to chemotherapeutic agents (multidrug resistance) in vitro. The expression of MRP by neuroblastoma cells correlates with N-myc oncogene amplification, a well-established prognostic indicator in patients with neuroblastoma. METHODS. To relate MRP gene expression to established prognostic markers and the clinical outcome of neuroblastoma, we analyzed MRP expression in specimens of primary tumors from 60 patients with neuroblastoma. RESULTS. Levels of MRP gene expression were significantly higher in tumors with N-myc amplification than in tumors without such amplification (P < 0.001). High levels of MRP expression were strongly associated with reductions in both survival and event-free survival (P < 0.001) in the overall study population and in subgroups of patients without N-myc amplification and patients with localized disease. For the overall study population, the five-year cumulative survival rates in the groups with high and low levels of MRP expression were 57 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 37 to 78 percent) and 94 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 86 to 100 percent), respectively. In contrast, expression of the MDR1 multi-drug-resistance gene was not predictive of survival or event-free survival. After adjustment by multivariate analysis for the effects of N-myc amplification and other prognostic indicators, high levels of MRP expression retained significant prognostic value for poor survival (relative hazard, 14.9; P = 0.01) and poor event-free survival (relative hazard, 9.7; P = 0.004), whereas N-myc amplification had no prognostic value. CONCLUSIONS. High levels of MRP gene expression in patients with neuroblastoma correlate strongly with poor outcome. The findings suggest that expression of this multidrug-resistance gene accounts for the association between N-myc amplification and reduced survival.}

  ABSTRACT = {The traditional motivation behind feature selection algorithms is to find the best subset of features for a task using one particular learning algorithm. Given the recent success of ensembles, however, we investigate the notion of ensemble feature selection in this paper. This task is harder than traditional feature selection in that one not only needs to find features germane to the learning task and learning algorithm, but one also needs to find a set of feature subsets that will promote disagreement among the ensemble\&\#039;s classifiers. In this paper, we present an ensemble feature selection approach that is based on genetic algorithms. Our algorithm shows improved performance over the popular and powerful ensemble approaches of AdaBoost and Bagging and demonstrates the utility of ensemble feature selection.},

  ABSTRACT = {MOTIVATION: Transcription factors (TFs) play a key role in gene regulation	by binding to target sequences. In silico prediction of potential	binding of a TF to a binding site is a well-studied problem in computational	biology. The binding sites for one TF are represented by a position	frequency matrix (PFM). The discovery of new PFMs requires the comparison	to known PFMs to avoid redundancies. In general, two PFMs are similar	if they occur at overlapping positions under a null model. Still,	most existing methods compute similarity according to probabilistic	distances of the PFMs. Here we propose a natural similarity measure	based on the asymptotic covariance between the number of PFM hits	incorporating both strands. Furthermore, we introduce a second measure	based on the same idea to cluster a set of the Jaspar PFMs. RESULTS:	We show that the asymptotic covariance can be efficiently computed	by a two dimensional convolution of the score distributions. The	asymptotic covariance approach shows strong correlation with simulated	data. It outperforms three alternative methods. The Jaspar clustering	yields distinct groups of TFs of the same class. Furthermore, a representative	PFM is given for each class. In contrast to most other clustering	methods, PFMs with low similarity automatically remain singletons.	AVAILABILITY: A website to compute the similarity and to perform	clustering, the source code and Supplementary Material are available	at http://mosta.molgen.mpg.de.},

  ABSTRACT = {Information integration systems allow users to express queries over high-level conceptual models. However, such queries must subsequently be evaluated over collections of sources, some of which are likely to be expensive to use or subject to periods of unavailability. As such, it would be useful if information integration systems were able to provide users with estimates of the consequences of omitting certain sources from query execution plans. Such omissions can affect both the soundness (the fraction of returned answers which are returned) and the completeness (the fraction of correct answers which are returned) of the answer set returned by a plan. Many recent information integration systems have used conceptual models expressed in description logics (DLs). This paper presents an approach to estimating the soundness and completeness of queries expressed in the ALCQI DL. Our estimation techniques are based on estimating the cardinalities of query answers. We have conducted some statistical evaluation of our techniques, the results of which are presented here. We also offer some suggestions as to how estimates for cardinalities of subqueries can be used to aid users in improving the soundness and completeness of query plans.},

  ABSTRACT = {Structured real world data can be represented with graphs whose structure encodes independence assumptions within the data. Due to statistical advantages over generative graphical models, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are used in a wide range of classification tasks on structured data sets. CRFs can be learned from both, fully or partially supervised data, and may be used to infer fully unlabeled or partially labelled data. However, performing inference in CRFs with an arbitrary graphical structure on a large amount of data is computational expensive and nearly intractable on a reseacher?s workstation. Hence, we take advantage of recent developments in computer hardware, namely general-purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). We not merely run given algorithms on GPUs, but present a novel framework of parallel algorithms at several levels for training general CRFs on very large data sets. We evaluate their performance in terms of runtime and F1 -Score.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework for feature selection in tree kernel spaces based on gradient-vector components of kernel-based machines. We show that a huge number of features can be discarded without a significant decrease in accuracy. Our selection algorithm is as accurate as and much more efficient than those proposed in previous work. Comparativeexperiments on three interesting and very diverse classification tasks, i.e. Question Classification, Relation Extraction and Semantic Role Labeling, support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the algorithm performance.}

  ABSTRACT = { Recent advances in space and computer technologies are revolutionizing the way remotely sensed data is collected, managed and interpreted. In particular, NASA is continuously gathering very high-dimensional imagery data from the surface of the Earth with hyperspectral sensors such as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's airborne visible-infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) or the Hyperion imager aboard Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) satellite platform. The development of efficient techniques for extracting scientific understanding from the massive amount of collected data is critical for space-based Earth science and planetary exploration. In particular, many hyperspectral imaging applications demand real time or near real-time performance. Examples include homeland security/defense, environmental modeling and assessment, wild-land fire tracking, biological threat detection, and monitoring of oil spills and other types of chemical contamination. Only a few parallel processing strategies for hyperspectral imagery are currently available, and most of them assume homogeneity in the underlying computing platform. In turn, heterogeneous networks of workstations (NOWs) have rapidly become a very promising computing solution which is expected to play a major role in the design of high-performance systems for many on-going and planned remote sensing missions. In order to address the need for cost-effective parallel solutions in this fast growing and emerging research area, this paper develops several highly innovative parallel algorithms for unsupervised information extraction and mining from hyperspectral image data sets, which have been specifically designed to be run in heterogeneous NOWs. The considered approaches fall into three highly representative categories: clustering, classification and spectral mixture analysis. Analytical and experimental results are presented in the context of realistic applications (based on hyperspectral data sets from the AVIRIS data repository) using several homogeneous and heterogeneous parallel computing facilities available at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland.}

  ABSTRACT = {The rapid development of space and computer technologies has made possible to store a large amount of remotely sensed image data, collected from heterogeneous sources. In particular, NASA is continuously gathering imagery data with hyperspectral Earth observing sensors such as the Airborne Visible-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) or the Hyperion imager aboard Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) spacecraft. The development of fast techniques for transforming the massive amount of collected data into scientific understanding is critical for space-based Earth science and planetary exploration. This paper describes commodity cluster-based parallel data analysis strategies for hyperspectral imagery, a new class of image data that comprises hundreds of spectral bands at different wavelength channels for the same area on the surface of the Earth. An unsupervised technique that integrates the spatial and spectral information in the image data using multi-channel morphological transformations is parallelized and compared to other available parallel algorithms. The code's portability, reusability and scalability are illustrated by using two high-performance parallel computing architectures: a distributed memory, multiple instruction multiple data (MIMD)-style multicomputer at European Center for Parallelism of Barcelona, and a Beowulf cluster at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Experimental results suggest that Beowulf clusters are a source of computational power that is both accessible and applicable to obtaining results in valid response times in information extraction applications from hyperspectral imagery.}

  ABSTRACT = {In the past decades, embedded system designers moved from simple, predictable system designs towards complex systems equipped with caches, branch prediction units and speculative execution. This step was necessary in order to fulfill increasing requirements on computational power. Static analysis techniques considering such speculative units had to be developed to allow the estimation of an upper bound of the execution time of a program. This bound is called worst-case execution time (WCET). Its knowledge is crucial to verify whether hard real-time systems satisfy their timing constraints, and the WCET is a key parameter for the design of embedded systems.In this paper, we propose a WCET-driven branch prediction aware optimization which reorders basic blocks of a function in order to reduce the amount of jump instructions and mispredicted branches. We employed a genetic algorithm which rearranges basic blocks in order to decrease the WCET of a program. This enables a first estimation of the possible optimization potential at the cost of high optimization runtimes. To avoid time consuming repetitive WCET analyses, we developed a new algorithm employing integer-linear programming (ILP). The ILP models the worst-case execution path (WCEP) of a program and takes branch prediction effects into account. This algorithm enables short optimization runtimes at slightly decreased optimization results. In a case study, the genetic algorithm is able to reduce the benchmarks? WCET by up to 24.7\% whereas our ILP-based approach is able to decrease the WCET by up to 20.0\%.}

  ABSTRACT = {In the past decades, embedded system designers moved from simple, predictable system designs towards complex systems equipped with caches. This step was necessary in order to bridge the increasingly growing gap between processor and memory system performance. Static analysis techniques had to be developed to allow the estimation of the cache behavior and an upper bound of the execution time of a program. This bound is called worst-case execution time (WCET). Its knowledge is crucial to verify whether hard real-time systems satisfy their timing constraints, and the WCET is a key parameter for the design of embedded systems.In this paper, we propose a WCET-aware optimization technique for static I-cache locking which improves a program?s performance and predictability. To select the memory blocks to lock into the cache and avoid time consuming repetitive WCET analyses, we developed a new algorithm employing integer-linear programming (ILP). The ILP models the worst-case execution path (WCEP) of a program and takes the influence of locked cache contents into account. By modeling the effect of locked memory blocks on the runtime of basic blocks, the overall WCET of a program can be minimized. We show that our optimization is able to reduce the WCET of real-life benchmarks by up to 40.8\%. At the same time, our proposed approach is able to outperform a regular cache by up to 23.8\% in terms of WCET.}

  ABSTRACT = {MOTIVATION: Proteomics has particularly evolved to become of high interest for the field of biomarker discovery and drug development. Especially the combination of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC/MS) has proven to be a powerful technique for analyzing protein mixtures. Clinically orientated proteomic studies will have to compare hundreds of LC/MS runs at a time. In order to compare different runs, sophisticated preprocessing steps have to be performed. An important step is the retention time (rt) alignment of LC/MS runs. Especially non-linear shifts in the rt between pairs of LC/MS runs make this a crucial and non-trivial problem. RESULTS: For the purpose of demonstrating the particular importance of correcting non-linear rt shifts, we evaluate and compare different alignment algorithms. We present and analyze two versions of a new algorithm that is based on regression techniques, once assuming and estimating only linear shifts and once also allowing for the estimation of non-linear shifts. As an example for another type of alignment method we use an established alignment algorithm based on shifting vectors that we adapted to allow for correcting non-linear shifts also. In a simulation study, we show that rt alignment procedures that can estimate non-linear shifts yield clearly better alignments. This is even true under mild non-linear deviations. AVAILABILITY: R code for the regression-based alignment methods and simulated datasets are available at http://www.statistik.tu-dortmund.de/genetik-publikationen-alignment.html. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this paper we offer a novel approach to control-oriented model validation problems. The problem is to decide whether a postulated nominal model with bounded uncertainty is consistent with measured input-output data. Our approach directly uses time-domain input-output data to validate uncertainty models. The algorithms we develop are computationally tractable and reduce to (generally nondifferentiable) convex feasibility problems or to linear programming problems. In special cases, we give analytical solutions to these problems},

  ABSTRACT = {Players of real-time strategy (RTS) games are often annoyed by the inability of the game AI to select and move teams of units in a natural way. Units travel and battle separately, resulting in huge losses and the AI looking unintelligent, as can the choice of units sent to counteract the opponents. Players are affected as well as computer commanded factions because they cannot micromanage all team related issues. We suggest improving AI behavior by combining well-known computational intelligence techniques applied in an original way. Team composition for battling spatially distributed opponent groups is supported by a learning self-organizing map (SOM) that relies on an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to adapt it to the game. Different abilities of unit types are thus employed in a near-optimal way, reminiscent of human ad hoc decisions. Team movement is greatly enhanced by flocking and influence map-based path finding, leading to a more natural behavior by preserving individual motion types. The team decision to either attack or avoid a group of enemy units is easily parametrizable, incorporating team characteristics from fearful to daredevil. We demonstrate that these two approaches work well separately, but also that they go together naturally, thereby leading to an improved and flexible group behavior.},

  ABSTRACT = {Confidentiality of information should be preserved despite the emergence of data outsourcing. An existing approach is supposed to achieve confidentiality by vertical fragmentation and without relying on encryption. Although prohibiting unauthorised (direct) accesses to confidential information, this approach has so far ignored the fact that attackers might infer sensitive information logically by deduction. In this article vertical fragmentation is modelled within the framework of Controlled Query Evaluation (CQE) allowing for inference-proof answering of queries. Within this modelling the inference-proofness of fragmentation is proved formally, even if an attacker has some a priori knowledge in terms of a rather general class of semantic database constraints.},

  ABSTRACT = {We present a discriminative part-based approach for the recognition of object classes from unsegmented cluttered scenes. Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts conditioned on local observations found by an interest operator. For each object class the probability of a given assignment of parts to local features is modeled by a Conditional Random Field (CRF). We propose an extension of the CRF framework that incorporates hidden variables and combines class conditional CRFs into a unified framework for part-based object recognition. The parameters of the CRF are estimated in a maximum likelihood framework and recognition proceeds by finding the most likely class under our model. The main advantage of the proposed CRF framework is that it allows us to relax the assumption of conditional independence of the observed data (i.e. local features) often used in generative approaches, an assumption that might be too restrictive for a considerable number of object classes.}

Petrie (1966) andgives practical details on methods of implementation of the theory alongwith a description of selected applications of the theory to distinctproblems in speech recognition. Results from a number of originalsources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring thebackground required to pursue further this area of research. The authorfirst reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how theconcept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilisticfunction of the state, can be used effectively. The theory isillustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and theclassic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs arenoted and several practical techniques for solving these problems aregiven. The various types of HMMs that have been studied, includingergodic as well as left-right models, are described}

  ABSTRACT = {Diseases of the lung, e. g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung diseases, bronchi-ectasis or cystic fibrosis, often lead to recurrent severe respiratory infections that cause exacerbations of the underlying disease. These acute or chronic inflammatory processes can result in a progressive destruction of the lung and in an ongoing decline in lung function. Therefore longer inpatient stays for intravenous antibiotic treatment are necessary and the quality of life in these patients is severely limited. A rapid detection of infectious agents in human lungs is often crucial, because the
choice of the appropriate therapeutic regime depends at first on
the identification of the infecting species. Standard methods for
detection and identification are either time consuming, of low
sensitivity or expensive. It is known that bacteria, and also
mitosporic fungi, produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be detected in exhaled breath by ion mobility spectrometry (IMS), were a distinct detection of a specific VOC is related to a ?peak?. We investigated, whether the detection and haracterisation of VOCs by Multi-capillary column coupled to IMS in exhaled breath of patients whose airways are either infected or colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa compared to healthy non-smoker controls is
capable of identifying those infectious agents. To realize a non invasive identification of pathogens, the exhaled breath of 53 persons (24 patients suffering chronic or infectious on Pseudomonas and 29 healthy controls) was investigated using an ion mobility spectrometer type BioScout. In total 224 different signals were found. Actually, 21 different signals are able to differentiate the two groups, Control and Pseudomonas, with rank sum values less than 0.2. For all 224 signals Box-and-Wisker plots were realized. The peaks with the lowest rank sum values F (0,107) and PS0 (0,112) show rather good separation of both groups. Our preliminary results demonstrate that distinct patterns of a small number of IMS-peaks are sufficient for the identification of these infectious agents. Therefore MCC-IMS seems to be a promising method
for the non-invasive identification of patients which are colonized or infected with bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa.},

  ABSTRACT = {Schema matching is a basic problem in many database application domains, such as data integration, E-business, data warehousing, and semantic query processing. In current implementations, schema matching is typically performed manually, which has significant limitations. On the other hand, previous research papers have proposed many techniques to achieve a partial automation of the match operation for specific application domains. We present a taxonomy that covers many of these existing approaches, and we describe the approaches in some detail. In particular, we distinguish between schema-level and instance-level, element-level and structure-level, and language-based and constraint-based matchers. Based on our classification we review some previous match implementations thereby indicating which part of the solution space they cover. We intend our taxonomy and review of past work to be useful when comparing different approaches to schema matching, when developing a new match algorithm, and when implementing a schema matching component.},

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: Image analysis is the first crucial step to obtain reliable    results from microarray experiments. First, areas in the image belonging    to single spots have to be identified. Then, those target areas have    to be partitioned into foreground and background. Finally, two scalar    values for the intensities have to be extracted. These goals have    been tackled either by spot shape methods or intensity histogram    methods, but it would be desirable to have hybrid algorithms which    combine the advantages of both approaches. RESULTS: A new robust    and adaptive histogram type method is pixel clustering, which has    been successfully applied for detecting and quantifying microarray    spots. This paper demonstrates how the spot shape can be effectively    integrated in this approach. Based on the clustering results, a bivalence    mask is constructed. It estimates the expected spot shape and is    used to filter the data, improving the results of the cluster algorithm.    The quality measure 'stability' is defined and evaluated on a real    data set. The improved clustering method is compared with the established    Spot software on a data set with replicates. CONCLUSION: The new    method presents a successful hybrid microarray image analysis solution.    It incorporates both shape and histogram features and is specifically    adapted to deal with typical microarray image characteristics. As    a consequence of the filtering step pixels are divided into three    groups, namely foreground, background and deletions. This allows    a separate treatment of artifacts and their elimination from the    further analysis.},

  ABSTRACT = {We present a statistical approach to scoring changes in activity of    metabolic pathways from gene expression data. The method identifies    the biologically relevant pathways with corresponding statistical    significance. Based on gene expression data alone, only local structures    of genetic networks can be recovered. Instead of inferring such a    network, we propose a hypothesis-based approach. We use given knowledge    about biological networks to improve sensitivity and interpretability    of findings from microarray experiments.Recently introduced methods    test if members of predefined gene sets are enriched in a list of    top-ranked genes in a microarray study. We improve this approach    by defining scores that depend on all members of the gene set and    that also take pairwise co-regulation of these genes into account.    We calculate the significance of co-regulation of gene sets with    a nonparametric permutation test. On two data sets the method is    validated and its biological relevance is discussed. It turns out    that useful measures for co-regulation of genes in a pathway can    be identified adaptively.We refine our method in two aspects specific    to pathways. First, to overcome the ambiguity of enzyme-to-gene mappings    for a fixed pathway, we introduce algorithms for selecting the best    fitting gene for a specific enzyme in a specific condition. In selected    cases, functional assignment of genes to pathways is feasible. Second,    the sensitivity of detecting relevant pathways is improved by integrating    information about pathway topology. The distance of two enzymes is    measured by the number of reactions needed to connect them, and enzyme    pairs with a smaller distance receive a higher weight in the score    calculation.},

  ABSTRACT = {MOTIVATION: In cancer research, prediction of time to death or relapse is important for a meaningful tumor classification and selecting appropriate therapies. Survival prognosis is typically based on clinical and histological parameters. There is increasing interest in identifying genetic markers that better capture the status of a tumor in order to improve on existing predictions. The accumulation of genetic alterations during tumor progression can be used for the assessment of the genetic status of the tumor. For modeling dependences between the genetic events, evolutionary tree models have been applied. RESULTS: Mixture models of oncogenetic trees provide a probabilistic framework for the estimation of typical pathogenetic routes. From these models we derive a genetic progression score (GPS) that estimates the genetic status of a tumor. GPS is calculated for glioblastoma patients from loss of heterozygosity measurements and for prostate cancer patients from comparative genomic hybridization measurements. Cox proportional hazard models are then fitted to observed survival times of glioblastoma patients and to times until PSA relapse following radical prostatectomy of prostate cancer patients. It turns out that the genetically defined GPS is predictive even after adjustment for classical clinical markers and thus can be considered a medically relevant prognostic factor.

  ABSTRACT = {The optimal treatment of patients with cancer depends on establishing accurate diagnoses by using a complex combination of clinical and histopathological data. In some instances, this task is difficult or impossible because of atypical clinical presentation or histopathology. To determine whether the diagnosis of multiple common adult malignancies could be achieved purely by molecular classification, we subjected 218 tumor samples, spanning 14 common tumor types, and 90 normal tissue samples to oligonucleotide microarray gene expression analysis. The expression levels of 16,063 genes and expressed sequence tags were used to evaluate the accuracy of a multiclass classifier based on a support vector machine algorithm. Overall classification accuracy was 78\%, far exceeding the accuracy of random classification (9\%). Poorly differentiated cancers resulted in low-confidence predictions and could not be accurately classified according to their tissue of origin, indicating that they are molecularly distinct entities with dramatically different gene expression patterns compared with their well differentiated counterparts. Taken together, these results demonstrate the feasibility of accurate, multiclass molecular cancer classification and suggest a strategy for future clinical implementation of molecular cancer diagnostics.},

  ABSTRACT = {Many intuitively appealing methods have been suggested for clustering data, however, interpretation of their results has been hindered by the lack of objective criteria. This article proposes several criteria which isolate specific aspects of the performance of a method, such as its retrieval of inherent structure, its sensitivity to resampling and the stability of its results in the light of new data. These criteria depend on a measure of similarity between two different clusterings of the same set of data; the measure essentially considers how each pair of data points is assigned in each clustering.},

  ABSTRACT = {Thema dieser Arbeit ist die Integration dreier grundlegender
Anforderungen an situierte Agenten: das maschinelle Lernen von
handlungs- und wahrnehmungsbezogenen Begriffen, die reaktive Planung
mit diesen Begriffen und die Verankerung der Kommunikation zwischen
situiertem Agenten und menschlichem Anwender in Handlungen und
Wahrnehmungen. Das Zusammenfuehren dieser Aspekte erfordert die
Repraesentation von Wahrnehmung und Handlung eines Agenten, die
Weiterentwicklung reaktiver Planungs- und Planausfuehrungverfahren
sowie die Spezialisierung maschineller Lernverfahren.

Um diese Anforderungen erfuellen zu koennen, haben wir zunaechst die
Notwendigkeit, Handlung und Wahrnehmung zu integrieren, bezueglich
sowohl der kognitiven als auch der pragmatischen Aspekte analysiert.
Begriffe, die einem Agenten das Handeln ermoeglichen, basieren darauf,
dass der Erfolg der Handlung mittels der Wahrnehmung verifiziert
werden kann, wobei die verwendeten Begriffe
Wahrnehmungs-Handlungs-Beziehungen darstellen.  Am Beispiel des
Karlsruher Roboter Priamos haben wir eine hierarchische
Repraesentation der Wahrnehmungen und Handlungen entwickelt. Die
Repraesentation verankert die zur Kommunikation verwendeten Begriffe,
die sich auf den abstrakten Stufen der Hierarchie befinden, ueber
mehrere Stufen in den konkreten Sensormessungen und
Elementaroperationen des Roboter.

Zur automatischen Charakterisierung der verwendeten Merkmale wurde das
induktive Lernverfahren Grdt entwickelt. Grdt vereint Aspekte
existierender Lernverfahren, indem es deklaratives Wissen ueber die
Struktur des Hypothesenraums zur Reduktion des Suchraums verwendet.
Dieses Modellwissen wird mit Hilfe einer Grammatik definiert. Auf Grund
des so reduzierten Suchraums kann Grdt den Hypothesenraum vollstaendig
durchsuchen, dies ist insbesondere bei verrauschten Daten hilfreich,
da keine potentielle Hypothese verpasst werden kann.

Ziel der Arbeit ist jedoch nicht nur die Charakterisierung von

operationalen Begriffen, sondern auch deren reaktive Ausfuehrung. Neu an
diesem Ansatz ist dabei, dass symbolisches Wissen verwendet wird, um
reaktiv die Wahrnehmungen des Agenten die Handlungen determinieren zu
lassen. Dazu wurde das mehrstufiges Verfahren Sharc entwickelt, das
basierend auf operationalen Begriffen plant und diese abstrakten
Plaene auf eine operationale Basis herunterbricht und reaktiv ausfuehrt.
Dabei ist das Sharc robust gegenueber fehlerhaften Messungen und
sicher gegenueber Gefaehrdung anderer.  

Die Anwendbarkeit dieser Ergebnisse wurde an Hand der Domaene der
mobilen Roboter nachgewiesen. Jedoch stellt diese Arbeit auch weitere
Anwendungen vor, die den Einsatz der entwickelten Verfahren rechtfertigen.},

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is a robust	platform for the profiling of certain classes of small molecules	in biological samples. When multiple samples are profiled, including	replicates of the same sample and/or different sample states, one	needs to account for retention time drifts between experiments. This	can be achieved either by the alignment of chromatographic profiles	prior to peak detection, or by matching signal peaks after they have	been extracted from chromatogram data matrices. Automated retention	time correction is particularly important in non-targeted profiling	studies. RESULTS: A new approach for matching signal peaks based	on dynamic programming is presented. The proposed approach relies	on both peak retention times and mass spectra. The alignment of more	than two peak lists involves three steps: (1) all possible pairs	of peak lists are aligned, and similarity of each pair of peak lists	is estimated; (2) the guide tree is built based on the similarity	between the peak lists; (3) peak lists are progressively aligned	starting with the two most similar peak lists, following the guide	tree until all peak lists are exhausted. When two or more experiments	are performed on different sample states and each consisting of multiple	replicates, peak lists within each set of replicate experiments are	aligned first (within-state alignment), and subsequently the resulting	alignments are aligned themselves (between-state alignment). When	more than two sets of replicate experiments are present, the between-state	alignment also employs the guide tree. We demonstrate the usefulness	of this approach on GC-MS metabolic profiling experiments acquired	on wild-type and mutant Leishmania mexicana parasites. CONCLUSION:	We propose a progressive method to match signal peaks across multiple	GC-MS experiments based on dynamic programming. A sensitive peak	similarity function is proposed to balance peak retention time and	peak mass spectra similarities. This approach can produce the optimal	alignment between an arbitrary number of peak lists, and models explicitly	within-state and between-state peak alignment. The accuracy of the	proposed method was close to the accuracy of manually-curated peak	matching, which required tens of man-hours for the analyzed data	sets. The proposed approach may offer significant advantages for	processing of high-throughput metabolomics data, especially when	large numbers of experimental replicates and multiple sample states	are analyzed.},

  ABSTRACT = {Interpretability is an important, yet often neglected criterion when applying machine learning algorithms to real-world tasks. An understandable model enables the user to gain more knowledge from his data and to participate in the knowledge discovery process in a more detailed way. Hence, learning interpretable models is a challenging task, whose complexity comes from the problems that interpretability is a fuzzy, subjective concept and human mental capabilities are in some ways astonishingly limited. At the same time, interpretability is a critical problem, because it is crucial for problems that cannot be solved purely automatically. The work presented in this thesis is structured along the three dimensions of understandability, accuracy, and efficiency. It contains contributions on the levels of the optimization of the interpretability of a learner with and without knowledge of its internals (white box and black box approach), the description of a models errors by lo...},

  ABSTRACT = {We demonstrate a concept and implementation of a compendium for the    classification of high-dimensional data from microarray gene expression    profiles. A compendium is an interactive document that bundles primary    data, statistical processing methods, figures, and derived data together    with the textual documentation and conclusions. Interactivity allows    the reader to modify and extend these components. We address the    following questions: how much does the discriminatory power of a    classifier depend on the choice of the algorithm that was used to    identify it; what alternative classifiers could be used just as well;    how robust is the result. The answers to these questions are essential    prerequisites for validation and biological interpretation of the    classifiers. We show how to use this approach by looking at these    questions for a specific breast cancer microarray data set that first    has been studied by Huang et al. (2003).},

  ABSTRACT = {Feature selection techniques have become an apparent need in many bioinformatics applications. In addition to the large pool of techniques that have already been developed in the machine learning and data mining fields, specific applications in bioinformatics have led to a wealth of newly proposed techniques. In this paper, we make the interested reader aware of the possibilities of feature selection, providing a basic taxonomy of feature selection techniques, and discussing their use, variety and potential in a number of both common as well as upcoming bioinformatics applications.

  ABSTRACT = {Successful medical emergency preventative measures or actual emergency resolution is not entirely down to one individual, but more the result of the establishment and behaviour of a group of individuals and services. This is highly evident in the healthcare domain: the introduction of pervasive healthcare systems allows for the interconnection of various stake holders, such as patients, doctors, medical monitoring services, and the patient?s family. Communication within a group can be extremely useful to manage and resolve emergency situations, such as helping a patient affected by a life-threatening hypogylcemic condition. At the same time, it also requires new tools for managing these groups in an effective and secure way. However, as more specialist services become available the management of these groups is increasing in magnitude. This paper defines different group types and proposes a framework, which allows for the dynamic management of such groups using policies. The applicability of this generic framework for the purpose of pervasive healthcare applications is demonstrated by concrete examples and use cases.},

  ABSTRACT = {Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial childhood tumor, comprising 15\% of all childhood cancer deaths. In an initial study, we used Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays to analyse gene expression in 68 primary neuroblastomas and compared different data mining approaches for prediction of early relapse. Here, we performed re-analyses of the data including prolonged follow-up and applied support vector machine (SVM) algorithms and outer cross-validation strategies to improve reliability of expression profiling based predictors. Accuracy of outcome prediction was significantly improved by the use of innovative SVM algorithms on the updated data. In addition, CASPAR, a hierarchical Bayesian approach, was used to predict survival times for the individual patient based on expression profiling data. CASPAR reliably predicted event-free survival, given a cut-off time of three years. Differential expression of genes used by CASPAR to predict patient outcome was validated in an independent cohort of 117 neuroblastomas. In conclusion, we show here for the first time that reanalysis of microarray data using improved methodology, state-of-the-art performance tests and updated follow-up data improves prognosis prediction, and may further improve risk stratification of individual patients.},

  ABSTRACT = {We develop stochastic variants of the well-known BFGS quasi-Newton    optimization method, in both full and memory-limited (LBFGS) forms,    for online optimization of convex functions. The resulting algorithm    performs comparably to a well-tuned natural gradient descent but is    scalable to very high-dimensional problems. On standard benchmarks in    natural language processing, it asymptotically outperforms previous    stochastic gradient methods for parameter estimation in conditional    random fields. We are working on analyzing the convergence of online    (L)BFGS, and extending it to non-convex optimization problems.}

  title = {Accurate Prediction of Neuroblastoma Outcome based on miRNA Expression Profiles},
  journal = {International Journal of Cancer},
  year = {2010},
  ID = {g9qtbi2u},
  ABSTRACT = {For neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial tumour of childhood, identification of new biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets is mandatory to improve risk stratification and survival rates. MicroRNAs are deregulated in most cancers, including neuroblastoma. We here analysed 430 miRNAs in 69 neuroblastomas by stem-loop RT-qPCR. Prediction of event-free survival (EFS) with Support Vector Machines (SVM) and actual survival times with Cox regression-based models (CASPAR) were highly accurate and were independently validated. SVM-accuracy for prediction of EFS was 88,7\% (95\%CI:88,5-88,8\%). For CASPAR-based predictions, 5y-EFS probability was 0.19\% (95\%CI:0-38\%) in the CASPAR-predicted short survival group compared to 0.78\% (95\%CI:64-93\%) in the CASPAR-predicted long survival group. Both classifiers were validated on an independent test set yielding accuracies of 94.74\%(SVM) and 5y-EFS probabilities as 0.25(95\%CI:0.0-0.55) for short vs 1±0.0 for long survival (CASPAR), respectively. Amplification of the MYCN oncogene was highly correlated with deregulation of miRNA expression. In addition, 37 miRNAs correlated with TrkA expression, a marker of excellent outcome, and 6 miRNAs further analysed in vitro were regulated upon TrkA transfection, suggesting a functional relationship. Expression of the most significant TrkA-correlated miRNA, miR-542-5p, also discriminated between local and metastatic disease and was inversely correlated with MYCN  amplification and event-free survival. We conclude that neuroblastoma patient outcome prediction using miRNA expression is feasible and effective. Studies testing miRNA-based predictors in comparison to and in combination with mRNA and aCGH information should be initiated. Specific miRNAs (e.g. miR-542-5p) might be important in neuroblastoma tumour biology, and qualify as potential therapeutic targets.},

  ABSTRACT = {Purpose: Genomic alterations of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene have been postulated to contribute to neuroblastoma pathogenesis. This study aimed to determine the interrelation of ALK mutations, ALK expression levels, and clinical phenotype in primary neuroblastoma.

Experimental Design: The genomic ALK status and global gene expression patterns were examined in 263 primary neuroblastomas. Allele-specific ALK expression was determined by cDNA cloning and sequencing. Associations of genomic ALK alterations and ALK expression levels with clinical phenotypes and transcriptomic profiles were compared.

Results: Nonsynonymous point mutations of ALK were detected in 21 of 263 neuroblastomas (8\%). Tumors with ALK mutations exhibited about 2-fold elevated median ALK mRNA levels in comparison with tumors with wild-type (WT) ALK. Unexpectedly, the WT allele was preferentially expressed in 12 of 21 mutated tumors. Whereas survival of patients with ALK mutated tumors was significantly worse as compared with the entire cohort of WT ALK patients, it was similarly poor in patients with WT ALK tumors in which ALK expression was as high as in ALK mutated neuroblastomas. Global gene expression patterns of tumors with ALK mutations or with high-level WT ALK expression were highly similar, and suggested that ALK may be involved in cellular proliferation in primary neuroblastoma.

Conclusions: Primary neuroblastomas with mutated ALK exhibit high ALK expression levels and strongly resemble neuroblastomas with elevated WT ALK expression levels in both their clinical and molecular phenotypes. These data suggest that high levels of mutated and WT ALK mediate similar molecular functions that may contribute to a malignant phenotype in primary neuroblastoma.

  ABSTRACT = {Preventing viral infections from spreading quickly in a heavily connected world demands for reliable diagnostic methods providing results promptly. The PAMONO biosensor (Plasmon Assisted Microscopy Of Nano-Objects) is a novel technique capable of attaining these properties.

In this paper, a processing pipeline is proposed for analyzing PAMONO sensor data. Firstly, virus candidate pixels are detected in the sensor output by matching their series of measured intensities over time to characteristic patterns. This is achieved in a fully parallel GPGPU approach. Each spatially coherent set of matching pixels defines a candidate object, represented as a polygon. The overall set of polygons encompasses true virus polygons as well as several types of false detections. The polygons are classified based on their shape, separating the viruses from false detections. With regard to this step, the suitability of different geometrical features (form-factors) and classification methods is explored. A set of classifiers consisting of Naive Bayes, RIPPER rule induction, C4.5 Decision Trees, k-Nearest-Neighbor and Support Vector Machines (SVM) is applied to a two- and to a multi-class formulation of the classification problem. Training and searching for robust optimal parameterizations of the parametric classifiers is achieved in an offline step, using evolutionary optimization. Furthermore, an evolutionary feature-selection is conducted for all classifiers. The classification performances are evaluated for different types of polystyrene nano-particles.

With regard to the diverse nature of the encountered artifacts, a one-class SVM approach, learning from positive examples only, is an attractive option. As will be shown, it can compete with the two- and multi-class approaches if training and test data originate from the same type of nano-particles.},

  ABSTRACT = {In genomic sequence analysis tasks like splice site recognition or promoter identification, large amounts of training sequences are available, and indeed needed to achieve sufficiently high classification performances. In this work we study two recently proposed and succesfully used kernels, namely the Spectrum kernel and the Weighted Degree kernel (WD). In particular we suggest several extensions using Suffix Trees and modifications of an SMO-like SVM training algorithm in order to accelerate the training of the SVMs and their evaluation on test sequences. Our simulations show that for the spectrum kernel and WD kernel, large scale SVM training can be accelerated by factors of 20 and 4 times, respectively, while using much less memory (e.g. no kernel caching). The evaluation on new sequences is often several thousand times faster using the new techniques (depending on the number of Support Vectors). Our method allows us to train on sets as large as one million sequences.},

  ABSTRACT = {The number of embedded systems is increasing and a remarkable percentage is designed as mobile applications. For the latter, the energy consumption is a limiting factor because of today's battery capacities. Besides the processor, memory accesses consume a high amount of energy. The use of additional less power hungry memories like caches or scratchpads is thus common.  Caches incorporate the hardware control logic for moving data in and out automatically. On the other hand, this logic requires chip area and energy. A scratchpad memory is much more energy efficient, but there is a need for software control of its content.In this paper, an algorithm integrated into a compiler is presented which analyses the application and selects program and data parts which are placed into the scratchpad. Comparisons against a cache solution show remarkable advantages between 12\% and 43\% in energy consumption for designs of the same memory size.},

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: Mass spectrometry is an essential analytical technique	for high-throughput analysis in proteomics and metabolomics. The	development of new separation techniques, precise mass analyzers	and experimental protocols is a very active field of research. This	leads to more complex experimental setups yielding ever increasing	amounts of data. Consequently, analysis of the data is currently	often the bottleneck for experimental studies. Although software	tools for many data analysis tasks are available today, they are	often hard to combine with each other or not flexible enough to allow	for rapid prototyping of a new analysis workflow. RESULTS: We present	OpenMS, a software framework for rapid application development in	mass spectrometry. OpenMS has been designed to be portable, easy-to-use	and robust while offering a rich functionality ranging from basic	data structures to sophisticated algorithms for data analysis. This	has already been demonstrated in several studies. CONCLUSION: OpenMS	is available under the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL) from the	project website at http://www.openms.de.},

  ABSTRACT = {We introduce a novel approach to incorporating domain knowledge into Support Vector Machines to improve their example efficiency. Domain knowledge is used in an Explanation Based Learning fashion to build justifications or explanations for why the training examples are assigned their given class labels. Explanations bias the large margin classifier through the interaction of trainig examples and domain knowledge. We develop a new learning algorithm for this Explanation-Augmented SVM (EA-SVM). It naturally extends to imperfect knowledge, a stumbling block to conventional EBL. Experimental results confirm desirable properties predicted by the analysis and demonstrate the approach on three domains.},

  ABSTRACT = {We have devised an approach to cancer class prediction from gene expression    profiling, based on an enhancement of the simple nearest prototype    (centroid) classifier. We shrink the prototypes and hence obtain    a classifier that is often more accurate than competing methods.    Our method of "nearest shrunken centroids" identifies subsets of    genes that best characterize each class. The technique is general    and can be used in many other classification problems. To demonstrate    its effectiveness, we show that the method was highly efficient in    finding genes for classifying small round blue cell tumors and leukemias.},

  ABSTRACT = {The importance of real-time capable mobile biosensors increases in face of rising numbers of global virus epidemics. Such biosensors can be used for on-site diagnosis, e.g. at airports, to prevent further spread of virus-transmitted diseases, by answering the question whether or not a sample contains a certain virus. In-depth laboratory analysis might furthermore demand for measurements of the concentration of virus particles in a sample. The novel PAMONO sensor technique allows for accomplishing both tasks. One of its basic prerequisites is an efficient analysis of the biosensor image data by means of digital image processing and classification. In this study, we present a high performance approach to this analysis: The diagnosis whether a virus occurs in the sample can be carried out in real-time with high accuracy. An estimate of the concentration can be obtained in real-time as well, if that concentration is not too high.

The contribution of this work is an optimization of our processing pipeline used for PAMONO sensor data analysis. The following objectives are optimized: detection-quality, speed and consumption of resources (e.g. energy, memory). Thus our approach respects the constraints imposed by medical applicability, as well as the constraints on resource consumption arising in embedded systems. The parameters to be optimized are descriptive (virus appearance parameters) and hardware-related (design space exploration).},

  ABSTRACT = {Most distributed classification approaches view data distribution as a technical issue and combine local models aiming at a single global model. This however,
  is unsuitable for inherently distributed databases, which are often described by more than one classification models that might differ conceptually. In this paper we present an
  approach for clustering distributed classifiers in order to discover groups of similar classifiers and thus similar databases with respect to a specific classification task. We
  also show that clustering distributed classifiers as a pre-processing step for classifier combination enhances the achieved predictive performance of the ensemble.},

  ABSTRACT = {The goal of this paper is to propose, evaluate, and                   compare four search strategies for ensemble feature                   selection, and to consider their application to medical                   diagnostics, with a focus on the problem of the                   classification of acute abdominal pain. Ensembles of                   learnt models constitute one of the main current                   directions in machine learning and data mining.                   Ensembles allow us to get higher accuracy, sensitivity,                   and specificity, which are often not achievable with                   single models. One technique, which proved to be                   effective for ensemble construction, is feature                   selection. Lately, several strategies for ensemble                   feature selection were proposed, including random                   subspacing, hill-climbing-based search, and genetic                   search. In this paper, we propose two new                   sequential-search-based strategies for ensemble feature                   selection, and evaluate them, constructing ensembles of                   simple Bayesian classifiers for the problem of acute                   abdominal pain classification. We compare the search                   strategies with regard to achieved accuracy,                   sensitivity, specificity, and the average number of                   features they select.},

  ABSTRACT = {We propose a mediator model for providing integrated and unified access to multiple taxonomy-based sources. Each source comprises a taxonomy and a database that indexes objects under the terms of the taxonomy. A mediator comprises a taxonomy and a set of relations between the mediator?s and the sources? terms, called articulations. By combining different modes of query evaluation at the sources and the mediator and different types of query translation, a flexible, efficient scheme of mediator operation is obtained that can accommodate various application needs and levels of answer quality. We adopt a simple conceptual modeling approach (taxonomies and intertaxonomy mappings) and we illustrate its advantages in terms of ease of use, uniformity, scalability, and efficiency. These characteristics make this proposal appropriate for a large-scale network of sources and mediators.},

  ABSTRACT = {The memory subsystem accounts for a significant portion of the aggregate energy budget of contemporary embedded systems. Moreover, there exists a large potential for optimizing the energy consumption of the memory subsystem. Consequently, novel memories as well as novel algorithms for their efficient utilization are being designed. Scratchpads are known to perform better than caches in terms of power, performance, area and predictability. However, unlike caches they depend upon software allocation techniques for their utilization. In this paper, we present an allocation technique which analyzes the application and inserts instructions to dynamically copy both code segments and variables onto the scratchpad at runtime. We demonstrate that the problem of dynamically overlaying scratchpad is an extension of the Global Register Allocation problem. The overlay problem is solved optimally using ILP formulation techniques. Our approach improves upon the only previously known allocation technique for statically allocating both variables and code segments onto the scratchpad. Experiments report an average reduction of 34\% and 18\% in the energy consumption and the runtime of the applications, respectively. A minimal increase in code size is also reported.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a probabilistic mixture modeling framework for the                    hierarchic organisation of document collections. It is demonstrated that the                    probabilistic corpus model which emerges from the automatic or unsupervised                    hierarchical organisation of a document collection can be further exploited to                    create a kernel which boosts the performance of state-of-the-art Support Vector                    Machine document classifiers. It is shown that the performance of such a                    classifier is further enhanced when employing the kernel derived from an                    appropriate hierarchic mixture model used for partitioning a document corpus                    rather than the kernel associated with a flat non-hierarchic mixture model. This                    has important implications for document classification when a hierarchic                    ordering of topics exists. This can be considered as the effective combination                    of documents with no topic or class labels (unlabeled data), labeled documents,                    and prior domain knowledge (in the form of the known hierarchic structure), in                    providing enhanced document classification performance.},

  ABSTRACT = {{The formalism of probabilistic graphical models provides a unifying framework for capturing complex dependencies among random variables, and building large-scale multivariate statistical models. Graphical models have become a focus of research in many statistical, computational and mathematical fields, including bioinformatics, communication theory, statistical physics, combinatorial optimization, signal and image processing, information retrieval and statistical machine learning. Many problems that arise in specific instances \&\#8212; including the key problems of computing marginals and modes of probability distributions \&\#8212; are best studied in the general setting. Working with exponential family representations, and exploiting the conjugate duality between the cumulant function and the entropy for exponential families, we develop general variational representations of the problems of computing likelihoods, marginal probabilities and most probable configurations. We describe how a wide variety of algorithms \&\#8212; among them sum-product, cluster variational methods, expectation-propagation, mean field methods, max-product and linear programming relaxation, as well as conic programming relaxations \&\#8212; can all be understood in terms of exact or approximate forms of these variational representations. The variational approach provides a complementary alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo as a general source of approximation methods for inference in large-scale statistical models.}}

  ABSTRACT = {Die Verf\"{u}gbarkeit echtzeitf\"{a}higer und mobiler Biosensoren gewinnt durch die zunehmende Verbreitung viraler Infektionen zunehmend an Bedeutung. Im Gegensatz zu Virusdetektionsmethoden wie beispielsweise ELISA erlaubt die neuartige Plasmonen-unterst\"{u}tzte Mikroskopie von Nanoobjekten, Proben innerhalb von wenigen Minuten auf Viren analysieren zu k\"{o}nnen. Die Herausforderung f\"{u}r ein, auf dieser Analysemethode beruhendes In-situ-Virusdetektionssystem, besteht in der Echtzeitverarbeitung von extrem hohen Datenmengen. Hier setzt die vorliegende Arbeit an, welche eine hoch parallele GPU-basierte Verarbeitungspipeline zur echtzeitf\"{a}higen Virusdetektion vorstellt. Durch die konsequente Ausnutzung der GPGPU-F\"{a}higkeiten von Grafikkarten kann auf teure Spezialhardware verzichtet werden, um eine echtzeitkonforme Beschleunigung notwendiger Bildverarbeitungs- und Bildanalysealgorithmen bereitzustellen, die auch den Anforderungen an ein eingebettetes Virusdetektionssystem gerecht wird.},

  ABSTRACT = {Human breath analysis is a powerful and especially a non-invasive technique for the monitoring and hopefully also for the diagnosis of respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The exhaled breath of 95 patients suffering COPD and of 35 healthy controls was investigated using an Ion Mobility Spectrometer (IMS) coupled to a Multi-Capillary Column (MCC) without any pre-separation or pre-enrichment. Starting with the results from a Mann?Whitney-Wilcoxon rank sum test to find analytes with the highest potential with respect to differentiation, box and whisker plots, metabolic maps and probability charts were introduced and compared. In addition, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and the accuracy of the relation were also summarized. The findings were compared to the results of a principal component analysis. Finally, decision trees were introduced to visualize the interdependencies between the analytes and the classifications. The application of these biostatistical methods with simultaneous inclusion of several VOCs for disease classification by ion mobility spectrometry of human breath will provide much more information than using single peaks and single concentration dependencies for disease classification and discrimination of various groups. Towards the future application of potential biomarkers for clinical diagnostic procedures, complex analytical methods, such as ion mobility spectrometry, need statistical and bioinformatical tools which are simple in application, visualize the results and support decisions on the basis of the data obtained from measurements of analytes in exhaled human breath.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper summarizes recent work at the University of Sheffield on	virtual screening methods that use 2D fingerprint measures of structural	similarity. A detailed comparison of a large number of similarity	coefficients demonstrates that the well-known Tanimoto coefficient	remains the method of choice for the computation of fingerprint-based	similarity, despite possessing some inherent biases related to the	sizes of the molecules that are being sought. Group fusion involves	combining the results of similarity searches based on multiple reference	structures and a single similarity measure. We demonstrate the effectiveness	of this approach to screening, and also describe an approximate form	of group fusion, turbo similarity searching, that can be used when	just a single reference structure is available.},

  ABSTRACT = {The increasing ubiquity of mobile embedded systems has been matched by the evolution of a variety of wireless network standards and technologies. The major constraints of wireless embedded systems are limitations of communication bandwidth, processing capabilities, and battery power. Remote wireless embedded systems often act as sensors, which provide data to a certain community. The exchange of data is nowadays usually realized through Web Services. For standard Web Services an XML parser is required, which demands a lot of processing power whereas embedded devices with their resource constraints provide only limited processing capabilities. Another drawback of standard Web Services is the huge communication overhead due to the use of human readable XML. On the other hand using standard Web Service technology enables service developers to easily integrate new embedded devices to their network or to the Internet. This paper reports on the on-going work of the key European research project MORE1, which brings the embedded system world together with the Web Services world. MORE introduces a new connector concept easing the handling of heterogeneous communication channels and µSOA for reducing the message size and processing demands for parsing XML messages.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper presents an approach to build Sparse Large Margin Classifiers (SLMC) by adding on more constraint to the standard Suppport Vector Machine (SVM) trainig problem. The added constraint explicitly controls the sparseness of the classifier and an approach is provided to solve the formulated problem. When considering the dual of this problem, it can be seen that building an SLMC is equivalent to constructing an SVM with a modified kernel version. Further analysis of this kernel function indicates that the proposed approach essentially finds a discriminating subspace that can be spanned by a small number of vectors, and in this subspace different classes of data are linearly well separated. Experimental results over several classification benchmarks show that in most cases the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art sparse learnig algortihms.},

  ABSTRACT = {Hypertext poses new research challenges for text classification. Hyperlinks,                    HTML tags, category labels distributed over linked documents, and meta data                    extracted from related Web sites all provide rich information for classifying                    hypertext documents. How to appropriately represent that information and                    automatically learn statistical patterns for solving hypertext classification                    problems is an open question. This paper seeks a principled approach to                    providing the answers. Specifically, we define five {\em hypertext regularities}                    which may (or may not) hold in a particular application domain, and whose                    presence (or absence) may significantly influence the optimal design of a                    classifier. Using three hypertext datasets and three well-known learning                    algorithms (Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbor, and First Order Inductive Learner),                    we examine these regularities in different domains, and compare alternative ways                    to exploit them. Our results show that the identification of hypertext                    regularities in the data and the selection of appropriate representations for                    hypertext in particular domains are crucial, but seldom obvious, in real-world                    problems. We find that adding the words in the linked neighborhood to the page                    having those links (both inlinks and outlinks) were helpful for all our                    classifiers on one data set, but more harmful than helpful for two out of the                    three classifiers on the remaining datasets. We also observed that extracting                    meta data from related Web sites was extremely useful for improving                    classification accuracy in some of those domains. Finally, the relative                    performance of the classifiers being tested provided insights into their                    strengths and limitations for solving classification problems involving diverse                    and often noisy Web pages.},

  ABSTRACT = {The evolution of drug resistance in HIV is characterized by the accumulation of resistance-associated mutations in the HIV genome. Mutagenetic trees, a family of restricted Bayesian tree models, have been applied to infer the order and rate of occurrence of these mutations. Understanding and predicting this evolutionary process is an important prerequisite for the rational design of antiretroviral therapies. In practice, mixtures models of K mutagenetic trees provide more flexibility and are often more appropriate for modelling observed mutational patterns. Here, we investigate the model selection problem for K-mutagenetic trees mixture models. We evaluate several classical model selection criteria including cross-validation, the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and the Akaike Information Criterion. We also use the empirical Bayes method by constructing a prior probability distribution for the parameters of a mutagenetic trees mixture model and deriving the posterior probability of the model. In addition to the model dimension, we consider the redundancy of a mixture model, which is measured by comparing the topologies of trees within a mixture model. Based on the redundancy, we propose a new model selection criterion, which is a modification of the BIC. Experimental results on simulated and on real HIV data show that the classical criteria tend to select models with far too many tree components. Only cross-validation and the modified BIC recover the correct number of trees and the tree topologies most of the time. At the same optimal performance, the runtime of the new BIC modification is about one order of magnitude lower. Thus, this model selection criterion can also be used for large data sets for which cross-validation becomes computationally infeasible.},

  ABSTRACT = {Methylation of CpG islands (CGIs) plays an important role in gene silencing. For genome-wide methylation analysis of CGIs in female white blood cells and in sperm, we used four restriction enzymes and a size selection step to prepare DNA libraries enriched with CGIs. The DNA libraries were treated with sodium bisulfite and subjected to a modified 454/Roche Genome Sequencer protocol. We obtained 163 034 and 129 620 reads from blood and sperm, respectively, with an average read length of 133 bp. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that 12 358 (7.6\%) blood library reads and 10 216 (7.9\%) sperm library reads map to 6167 and 5796 different CGIs, respectively. In blood and sperm DNA, we identified 824 (13.7\%) and 482 (8.5\%) fully methylated autosomal CGIs, respectively. Differential methylation, which is characterized by the presence of methylated and unmethylated reads of the same CGI, was observed in 53 and 52 autosomal CGIs in blood and sperm DNA, respectively. Remarkably, methylation of X-chromosomal CGIs in female blood cells was most often incomplete (25-75\%). Such incomplete methylation was mainly found on the X-chromosome, suggesting that it is linked to X-chromosome inactivation.},

  ABSTRACT = {Summary. We propose the elastic net, a new regularization and variable selection method. Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together.The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.}
