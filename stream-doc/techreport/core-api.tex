\section{The \streams Core Classes}
The \streams framework provides a wide range of implementations for
data streams and processors. These are useful for reading application
data and defining a complete data flow.

In this section we provide a comprehensive overview of the classes and
implementations already available in the \streams library. These can
directly be used to design stream processes for various application
domains.
