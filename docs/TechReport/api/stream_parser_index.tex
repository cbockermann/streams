\subsection{Package stream.parser}

When processing streams of data each single data item may contain
additional information that needs to be extracted into more detailed
attributes or into other value types.

The \texttt{stream.parser} package provides a set of parsing processors,
that usually act upon on or more keys and extract information from the
attributes denoted by those keys.

For example the \texttt{ParseDouble} processor will parse double values
from all strings that are denoted in its \texttt{keys} parameter. Other
parsers in this package are for example the \texttt{ParseJSON},
\texttt{Timestamp} or the \texttt{NGrams} processor.
