\Package{stream.flow}
The \texttt{stream.flow} package contains processors that allow for data
flow control within a process setup. Processors in this package are
usually processor-lists, i.e.~they may provide nested processors that
are executed based on conditions.

A typical example for control flow is given with the following
\texttt{If} processor, which executes the \texttt{PrintData} processor
only, if the value of attribute \texttt{x1} is larger than 0.5.
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \begin{lstlisting}{lang=xml}
        <If condition="\%{data.x1} @gt 0.5">
          <PrintData />
        </If>
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}
Other flow control processors provide control of data queues such as
enqueuing events into other processes' queues.
