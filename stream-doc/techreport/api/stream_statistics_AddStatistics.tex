\subsubsection{AddStatistics}

This processor uses a StatisticsService to query current statistics and
add these to the data item that is being processed. Such statistics may
for example be provided by
\href{../monitor/MemoryUsage.html}{MemoryUsage}.

\subparagraph{Example}

The following example defines a simple monitor thread that will be run
every 5 seconds. Each time it is executed, the \texttt{MemoryUsage}
processor will estimate the current JVM memory and store it in key
\texttt{@memory:jvm}.

The \texttt{AddStatistics} processor will then add the statistics
elements provided by the \texttt{MemoryUsage} service to the current
item. Finally the Plotter will plot the attribute \texttt{@memory:jvm}.

\begin{verbatim}
 <Monitor interval="5seconds">

    <MemoryUsage id="mem:usage" />

    <stream.statistics.AddStatistics service="mem:usage" />

    <stream.plotter.Plotter keys="@memory:jvm" />
 </Monitor>
\end{verbatim}
