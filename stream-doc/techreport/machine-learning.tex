\section{\label{sec:machineLearning}Machine Learning with Continuous Data}
As the large volumes of data are merely handable with automatic
processing of that data, they are far away from being inspected
manually. On the other hand gaining insight from that data is the key
problem in various application domains.

Machine learning and data mining has put forth a plethora of
techniques and algorithms for pattern recognition, learning of
prediction model or clustering that all aim at exactly that key
problem: knowledge discover from data.

For the setting of continuous data, various algorithms have been
proposed which solve basic tasks inherent to the knowledge discovery
process as well as complex methods that allow for training classifiers
or finding clusters on steady streams of data. In this section we will
give an overview of the machine learning algorithms that have been
implemented within the \streams framework as well as the integration
of an existing library, namely the MOA \cite{MOA}, which provides a
rich set of state of the art online learning algorithms. 

After that overview in Section \ref{sec:onlineLearning}, we discuss
the problem of the {\em online application} of machine learning models
which have either been trained online of offline, and then are used to
make real-life predictions on streaming data. This will be covered in
Section \ref{sec:onlineApplication}.
