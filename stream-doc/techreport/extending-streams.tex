\section{\label{sec:extendingStreams}Extending the \streams Framework}
In the previous sections we outlined how to create data flow graphs for
data stream processing by means of the XML elements that are provided
by the \streams framework. We also introduced the {\em processor}s as
the atomic functional units that provide the work required to do the
data processing.

The core \streams framework provides a rich set of basic processors that
can be used to aggregate statistics, manipulate data and even incorporates
existing libraries such as the {\em MOA} online learning library (see
Section \ref{sec:moa} for details on using MOA with \streams).

In many application use cases, we still face the problem of requiring
application specific pre-processing or functionality that cannot directly be 
achieved with the existing \streams core processors. Such functionality
can easily be added by custom implementations of processors. The \streams
framework provides a very simply Java API which encapsultes the abstract
concepts outlined in Section \ref{sec:abstraction}.

\medskip

In this section, we will highlight the general ideas of the \streams
programming API and provide a walk-through on how to implement custom
processors using the Java language. 

As pointed out earlier, the \streams framework also provides support
for scripting languages, such as JavaScript, Ruby or Python. In Section
\ref{sec:scripting} we will give an overview on how to implement custom
processors using such scripting languages.
