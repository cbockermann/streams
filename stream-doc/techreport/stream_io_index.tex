%\subsubsection{Package {\ttfamily stream.io}}

Reading data is usually the first step in data processing. The package
{\ttfamily stream.io} provides a set of data stream implementations
for data files/resources in various formats.

All of the streams provided by this package do read from URLs, which
allows reading from files as well as from network URLs such as HTTP
urls or plain input streams (e.g. standard input).

The streams provide an iterative access to the data and use the default
\texttt{DataFactory} for creating data. They do usually share some
common parameters supported by most of the streams such as
\texttt{limit} or \texttt{username} and \texttt{password}.

\subsubsection*{Defining a Stream}
As previously discussed in Section \ref{sec:definingProcesses}, a
stream is defined within a container using the XML {\ttfamily stream}
element, providing a {\ttfamily url} and {\ttfamily class} attribute
which determines the source to read from and the class that should
be used for reading from that source.

As a simple example, the following XML snippet defines a data stream
that reads data items in CSV format from some file URL:
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{lstlisting}{lang=xml}
    <stream  id="csv-data" class="stream.io.CsvStream"
            url="file:/tmp/example.csv" />
\end{lstlisting}
\end{center}
