\subsubsection{TrimKeys}

This operator removes leading and trailing whitespaces from all keys of
a data item, i.e.~the item

\begin{verbatim}
 x1  =1.0
\end{verbatim}
will be transformed to

\begin{verbatim}
 x1=1.0
\end{verbatim}
as the key ``\texttt{x1}'' will be renamed to ``\texttt{x1}'' (without
the quotes).
