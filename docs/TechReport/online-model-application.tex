\subsection{\label{sec:onlineApplication}Model Application on Data Streams}

As previously outlined in Section \ref{sec:onlineLearning}, each
classifier provides a service that can be used to access or use its
model. Such services can for example be a {\em PredictionService},
which provides a prediction function for a data item. The former
section mainly focused on the online training of such classifiers,
whereas in this part, we deal with the application of such
classifier/learning output to online data streams.

There are two key aspects we want to discuss here, namely the use of
classifier models for the evaluation of online learning algorithms in
Section \ref{sec:evalOnline} and the general benefit of applying
models that may even have been trained offline in the setting of
continuous data streams in Section \ref{sec:applyOnline}.

%% A simple but important use of online model application is the 
%% evaluation of classifiers on online data streams.

%% This section should give an example walk-through for test-then-train
%% and demonstrate an example container that evaluates a classifier (MOA?)
%% on a data stream.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:evalOnline}Evaluating Classifiers on a Stream}




%%
%% Section about the need to create a model on offline data and
%% using that model on dynamic continuous data streams. 
%% Outline:
%%   - high-level (short) introduction to a use-case
%%   - outlining the offline training of models
%%   - incorporation of the models into the streams library
%%   - maybe a more detailed example to sum up (plus container definiton in the appendix?)
