\section{\label{sec:processDesign}Designing Stream Processes}
The former section introduced the main conceptual elements of the \streams library.
These basic elements are used to define stream processes that can be deployed and
executed with the \streams runtime environment.

The definition of stream processes is based on simple XML files that define processes,
streams and queues by XML elements that directly correspond to the elements presented
in Section \ref{sec:abstraction}.
