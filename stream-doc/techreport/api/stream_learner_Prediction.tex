\subsubsection{Prediction}

This processor references one or more learner elements using the
\texttt{ref} attribute. All the referenced elements need to provide a
prediction model, i.e.~need to implement the ModelProvider interface.

The processor will add the prediction of all referenced learners to the
data item. The prediction is prefixed with the \texttt{@prediction:}
string, followed by the name of the model (usually the ID of the learner
element).
