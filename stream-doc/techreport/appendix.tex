\part{API Documentation}

The intention of the \streams framework is to start from a minimal set
of core concepts and allow for building solutions for more complex
problems on top of that. The main part of this report is a description
of the concepts that mainly focus on establishing a data-flow
definition language.

For running data flow experiments defined with the \streams we provide
an introduction into the \streams {\em runtime} environment in Section
\ref{sec:streamsRuntime}.

\bigskip

The remainder of this document includes a comprehensive documentation
of a set of processors that constitute the \streams API. These
elements provide a toolbox for handling various processing steps and
are described in Section \ref{sec:streamAPI}.

%\bigskip
%Finally this appendix includes the full definitions of the containers
%for some of the use cases, e.g. the FACT telescope data, in Section
%\ref{sec:factAPI}.
