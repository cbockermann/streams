Delay
=====

This simple processor puts a delay into the data processing. The
delay can be specified in various units with the simple time format
being specified like:

      40ms

for specifying a delay of 40 milliseconds. Other units for `day`,
`hour`, `minute` and so on work as well. 

The units can also be combined as in `1 second 30ms`.
